## Gui Zhou (Stories of the Return)
~~~
date 2024.6
id guizhou
~~~
American film director Yu Ge travels to Taipei, Taiwan, to shoot a script that her mother was never able to complete before her passing, in hopes of gaining a better understanding of her mother’s homeland and heritage. Two stories of searching are told in parallel—the present-day story of a director and the film within her film, set during the 1980s Taiwan economic boom. As generational, cultural, and geographical gaps are tested, Yu Ge's tenuous relationships with her actors and her late mother are pushed to the brink.

Written and shot in Taipei, Taiwan in the summer of 2024. *GuiZhou* is a project that has been greatly supported by the University of Virginia, having received three significant grants: the University Undergraduate Award for Arts Project, the Miller Arts Rising 4th Year Award, and the Echols Ingrassia Research Fund.

a rolling stone gathers no moss addresses collective art-making through resonant conversations and lingering stretches of shared imagination. At the secluded Biological Research Station at Pembroke, Virginia, an analogous relationship between creative and scientific processes surfaced. It was one of trial and error, and at times, much frustration. When things come to a halt, one turns to community, conversing and exchanging ideas until it feels right to venture out again. And the effect is often a rippling one. The flow of inspiration from person to person, like the complex ecological networks that surround us, underscore the symbiotic relationship between the creator of the film and the many creators within the film. Between the artists, fantastical visions are transposed and realized, while ideas of transparency, authorial voice, and “candidness” are stretched, amplified, and questioned. This film was first screened at Mountain Lake at our student Artlab Showcase and was officially selected for the Down East Flick Fest in Greenville, North Carolina where it will be screened in late November.

## Remember the Wolf
Wolves once roamed Virginia, but predator control programs and habitat destruction made their numbers dwindle, until they were finally declared extinct in 1980. Frequenting childhood tales, wolves are a symbol of cunning and corruption. But what happens when the very things we warn children about are eliminated due to our collective, irreversible damage? Created by previous art resident Ed Miller at Mountain Lake, The Red Wolf wearily watches over the coming and going of field scientists, researchers, and their families to the research station. Spotting the statue in the dark, a displaced urbanite might scurry, not knowing that the only wolves that remain in the mountains are made from clay. On the surface, Mountain Lake is a secluded sanctuary – no cellular connection, lots of overgrown trails, and a self-sufficient plumbing system. Seeing a fallen Hemlock teeming with decomposers, beetles and fungus, one might muse at primordial beauty and remark on the cycle of life and the transient presence of humankind. But even so, the world around it is changing. Due to its elevation, the station had been free from poison ivy and ticks – until recently. The increase in temperatures have catalyzed these creatures’ slow creep to the station, including one that eats away at the hemlock population. Perhaps it’s time to start from scratch, turn to the very ecological networks that we harm, fighting for harmony. In Remember the Wolf, five photos meditate on stories passed down from generation to generation as the warning bells of the climate crisis crescendo.

## Rooted
Autumn Samone, in her series of images in _Rooted_, taken by Jolinna Li, creates a tree sculpture with synthetic hair, framing it alongside her body and the ethereal forest floor. Often considered "natural looking", protective hair styles in black communities often use synthetic elements. Through these plays on what is considered "natural", Samone connects the performance that is culturally integral to black identity to her own bodily performance in front of the camera.
