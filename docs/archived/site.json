At the secluded Biological Research Station at Pembroke, Virginia, an analogous relationship between creative and scientific processes surfaced. It was one of trial and error, and at times, much frustration. When things come to a halt, one turns to community, conversing and exchanging ideas until it feels right to venture out again. And the effect is often a rippling one. The flow of inspiration from person to person, like the complex ecological networks that surround us, underscore the symbiotic relationship between the creator of the film and the many creators within the film. Between the artists, fantastical visions are transposed and realized, while ideas of transparency, authorial voice, and “candidness” are stretched, amplified, and questioned. This film was first screened at Mountain Lake at our student Artlab Showcase and was officially selected for the Down East Flick Fest in Greenville, North Carolina where it will be screened in late November.</p></div><iframe class=film-yt src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgWBt0oGZjU\" title=\"YouTube player for a rolling stone gathers no moss\" frameborder=0 allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe><div class=stills><img class=still src='../media/a-rolling-stone-gathers-no-moss/1.webp'><img class=still src='../media/a-rolling-stone-gathers-no-moss/2.webp'><img class=still src='../media/a-rolling-stone-gathers-no-moss/3.webp'><img class=still src='../media/a-rolling-stone-gathers-no-moss/4.webp'><img class=still src='../media/a-rolling-stone-gathers-no-moss/5.webp'><img class=still src='../media/a-rolling-stone-gathers-no-moss/6.webp'><img class=still src='../media/a-rolling-stone-gathers-no-moss/7.webp'><img class=still src='../media/a-rolling-stone-gathers-no-moss/8.webp'><img class=still src='../media/a-rolling-stone-gathers-no-moss/9.webp'><img class=still src='../media/a-rolling-stone-gathers-no-moss/10.webp'><img class=still src='../media/a-rolling-stone-gathers-no-moss/11.webp'></div>","title_display":"a rolling stone gathers no moss","group":"experimental"},"wreck":{"page":"<div class=film-intro><h2 class=film-title>wreck</h2><div class=film-details><span></span><span>Digital, Blackmagic HD</span></div><p>Through visual and aural language, this film opens discussion between the impermanence of the individual alongside the irreparable effects humankind has had on the environment.

Frequenting childhood tales, wolves are a symbol of cunning and corruption. But what happens when the very things we warn children about are eliminated due to our collective, irreversible damage? Created by previous art resident Ed Miller at Mountain Lake, The Red Wolf wearily watches over the coming and going of field scientists, researchers, and their families to the research station. Spotting the statue in the dark, a displaced urbanite might scurry, not knowing that the only wolves that remain in the mountains are made from clay. On the surface, Mountain Lake is a secluded sanctuary – no cellular connection, lots of overgrown trails, and a self-sufficient plumbing system. Seeing a fallen Hemlock teeming with decomposers, beetles and fungus, one might muse at primordial beauty and remark on the cycle of life and the transient presence of humankind. But even so, the world around it is changing. Due to its elevation, the station had been free from poison ivy and ticks – until recently. The increase in temperatures have catalyzed these creatures’ slow creep to the station, including one that eats away at the hemlock population. Perhaps it’s time to start from scratch, turn to the very ecological networks that we harm, fighting for harmony. In Remember the Wolf, five photos meditate on stories passed down from generation to generation as the warning bells of the climate crisis crescendo.</p></div><div class=stills><img class=still src='../media/remember-the-wolf/1.webp'><img class=still src='../media/remember-the-wolf/2.webp'><img class=still src='../media/remember-the-wolf/3.webp'><img class=still src='../media/remember-the-wolf/4.webp'><img class=still src='../media/remember-the-wolf/5.webp'></div>","title_display":"Remember the Wolf","group":"photography"},"rooted":{"page":"<div class=photography-intro><h2 class=photography-title>Rooted</h2><p>Autumn Samone, in her series of images in <em>Rooted</em>, taken by Jolinna Li, creates a tree sculpture with synthetic hair, framing it alongside her body and the ethereal forest floor.

So much so, that when Aneilia’s mechanical pencil was tossed onto her desk, Novalie nearly fell completely over the edge of her seat. Novalie swiftly deconstructed the mechanical pencil and pulled out a tiny scrolled-up piece of paper with a note in impossibly minuscule writing.</p>\n<p><em>My parents are ok with dinner. 6 pm Friday. 118 April Lane.</em></p>\n<p>Novalie had been asking to hang out at Aneilia’s house for forever. She turned back to face Aneilia but found her busy observing the group of girls in the back of the classroom, all surrounding Liv Burman, who hated Aneilia and made everyone hate her too. Liv was the reason why Novalie started eating cafeteria food and stopped bringing packed lunches.</p>\n<p>Aneilia didn’t seem to understand that people could hate her. She treated Liv the same as she treated everyone, bombarding them with questions.</p>\n<p>“Why don’t eighth graders have recess?” asked Aneilia. “We have a fifteen-minute outdoor break but they stopped calling it recess.”</p>\n<p>“Because we’re not kindergarteners anymore,” said Liv.</p>\n<p>“I do notice that kids start sticking to stricter social hierarchies, and into these gendered… herds,” offered Aneilia. “What are your thoughts on this?”</p>\n<p>Novalie was both envious of and repulsed by her shamelessness. The girls around Liv giggled quietly as they eagerly waited for Liv’s response.</p>\n<p>Liv flared her nostrils, flashing the whites of her eyes at her. “Yeah whatever Aneilia, stop making a big fuss and go be a kindergartener with Mariam Webster over there,” she said, referencing Novalie’s nickname. “We’re talking about the end of the year formal, very grown-up business you wouldn’t understand.”</p>\n<p>Aneilia shrugged, unbothered. Liv looked over at Novalie and sneered. Novalie felt herself shrink and avert Liv’s gaze, waiting for her to turn back to her posse before mustering a tight smile at Aneilia. She weakly held up the mechanical pencil to confirm their plans for later that week.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>“What kind of food do humans like?” Aneilia asked her partners Bill and Sue.</p>\n<p>Bill opened their completely empty fridge, grinding his teeth. The three of them stood in their magazine-cover kitchen, not a single utensil or pot in sight.</p>\n<p>“Lasagna,” said Sue. She looked down at her arms, then at Bill’s, and then finally at Aneilia. “We look like we can pass for Italians, maybe not Aneilia though.”</p>\n<p>Aneilia tucked her blonde hair behind her ears. “I told them to give me brown hair, this is a genetic rarity, to have two dark-haired parents.”</p>\n<p>Bill shook his head. “I dunno, humans reek of infidelity, maybe my wife procreated with another man with lighter hair–”</p>\n<p>“Shut up,” said Sue. “There is no time mulling over what we cannot change. What we <em>can</em> do is focus on not letting this young human see through our cover.”</p>\n<p>Bill clicked his tongue in a way that made a glassy, crinkling sound. “Novalie is of Chinese descent, do you think she would react poorly to pasta?”</p>\n<p>Aneilia shook her head. “She mostly eats dining hall food anyways, which is pretty American.”</p>\n<p>Bill sighed. “Work is so easy, I drive to the big box, type for eight hours, smile at coworkers, and then come home. How does one talk to a human child?”</p>\n<p>Aneilia began to say something but Sue cut her off. “You’re a human child too so you don’t need to adhere to the customs as much. And I’ve seen your reports, you are far too aggressive with your intel gathering.”</p>\n<p>Aneilia squinted with annoyance. “Nobody answers questions like Novalie. She does not do the things the rest do with their eyes.”</p>\n<p>Bill and Sue smiled, together, they rolled their eyes in slow motion.</p>\n<p>“It’s so crude. I’ve noticed that this behavior peaks at age twenty-five and then subsequently drops,” said Sue.</p>\n<p>“Huh,” said Bill, “I thought it just got worse over time.”</p>\n<p>Aneilia sighed. “It’ll be weird for me to be seen at one of their depots, can the two of you buy the lasagna by Friday? We also need props. Forks and… chopsticks?”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said Bill.</p>\n<p>“Respect customs,” agreed Sue. “We will refrain from asking too many questions, act amicably, and hopefully her suspicions will lower.”</p>\n<p>“How long has she been investigating the coast now?” asked Bill.</p>\n<p>“Unsure,” replied Aneilia. “When we met last semester at Braddock, she had been investigating for a while, and had already printed out photographs of our lights.”</p>\n<p>Sue sighed. “I just hope it doesn’t come down to termination.”</p>\n<p>Bill shook his head. “Don’t even mention it, casualties are to be as minimal as possible.”</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>What to wear? Novalie and her mom struggled over which of her dresses to don for the occasion at the end of the week. The two garish garments lay limp and wrinkled on the couch, an iron heating up on the kitchen counter.</p>\n<p>“Xiao Jiu,” her mother said her Chinese name, “Did you think of a present to bring them?”</p>\n<p>Novalie paused, wondering for a moment if she should lie.</p>\n<p>“I forgot,” she said.</p>\n<p>Her mom made a disappointed exhale and walked towards Novalie’s room.</p>\n<p>“Wait! I told you not to go in there!” said Novalie, and all of the strength in her legs powered her as she raced to her room and blocked the entranceway. Her mother acquiesced.</p>\n<p>Novalie smiled sweetly. “What were you going to grab?”</p>\n<p>“Just the basket on your closet’s top shelf. I got some fruit today. We can scrap together an arrangement,” her mother replied.</p>\n<p>Novalie moved quickly to find the item her mom wanted, bringing a stool to her closet and rummaging through the ruckus. Lisa Sun was a surgeon in China but after moving to America, her job was to raise Novalie. Though she never seemed to let go of her excruciating precision when it came to judgment and criticism.</p>\n<p>From up on her stool, Novalie cast a wary glance at her desk, what she was guarding from her mother. She wasn’t going to expose the investigations to her until she was sure.</p>\n<p>One could find a small universe sprawled on the underbelly of the cheap IKEA writing desk: newspaper clippings of alien sightings, Aneilia’s illegible poetry scrawled on math homework, and endless photographs of the Athens beach painstakingly scotch taped to the cheap chipboard. They were almost all pitch black, all taken at night, and each depicted the same thing, the Seabrights: three silver rings of light hovering above the waves.</p>\n<p>As Novalie fished out the basket from the back of the top shelf, she remembered the first time Aneilia was in her room. She had caught Aneilia standing before the photo frame her mom bought from TJ Maxx, the one that still had its stock photo: a blonde girl frozen in a field surrounded by sunflowers.</p>\n<p>Novalie herself had been startled by how similar her friend looked to the girl in the photo. It wasn’t just because Aneilia was blonde too. Her face was extreme in its symmetricality and had a quality about it that made it both hard to remember and to forget. Extreme genericness.</p>\n<p>Novalie had watched as Aneilia noticed the resemblance herself, her eyes shifting from the photograph to Novalie’s makeup mirror, a look of surprise stricken on her face as if she were looking at someone else. At that moment, Aneilia, who was unusually skittish and noticed any minute changes in noise or movement, was completely frozen like the girl in the photograph, unaware of Novalie’s presence. She looked haunted. Her light gray eyes were wide and she had a hollow look about her. And then Novalie saw it: a silver glint in Aneilia’s eyes, a sharp shade of lightning gray that she had not seen anywhere else, except…</p>\n<p>The wicker basket was coated in dust and made Novalie sneeze explosively as she lowered it from its shelf. She presented it to her mother.</p>\n<p>“Thank you, this is perfect,” was the response she got. Her mother ran a wet rag over the basket and let out a hopeful sigh.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Novalie pedaled into the dark.</p>\n<p>“How the fuck are you going that fast?” Aneilia called out from behind. Novalie hated Aneilia’s new obsession with curse words.</p>\n<p>“Dunno, guess you’re just too fucking slow,” Novalie yelled back. She had waited at the edge of Aneilia’s driveway, whispering into one of two electric blue walkie-talkies until Aneilia also slipped out her window.</p>\n<p>They were riding through Athens, a small beach town that was completely flat and bad at tourism even though that was its only chance at survival.</p>\n<p>“Where are we going?” hollered Aneilia.</p>\n<p>A year ago, their friendship had begun with bike rides, Novalie as the local and Aneilia as the new kid in town. Novalie quickly exhausted the usual spots: the diner, the one and only strip mall, the Food Lion. Now they just biked for the sake of biking, occasionally stopping at a memorable tree or parking lot to talk and eat candy bars.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to the beach,” said Novalie.</p>\n<p>“Is it too late at night to go to the beach?”</p>\n<p>“That’s kind of the point.”</p>\n<p>Aneilia stopped her bike completely.</p>\n<p>“What are you doing?” asked Novalie, whipping her head back. She stopped too, nobody was out on the street this late. “There’s something I wanted to show you for a while now but you have to promise not to tell anyone.”</p>\n<p>Aneilia shifted uneasily. “Can’t you just tell me now?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“Are you scared of the water? We aren’t getting in. It’s just something I can’t explain with words, you wouldn’t believe me anyway,” said Novalie.</p>\n<p>“Ok, I will comply,” said Aneilia.</p>\n<p>They rode for a while before Aneilia spoke again.</p>\n<p>“Why are you showing me this now?”</p>\n<p>Novalie didn’t know herself. “I just spend a lot of my time recording this… phenomenon. Like <em>really recording</em> it. But it doesn’t seem real until I tell someone. You know?”</p>\n<p>Aneilia shrugged. “Even if you didn’t tell anyone, it doesn’t make it less real.”</p>\n<p>But Novalie pretended she didn’t hear. Instead, she let the wind rip at their ears and they rode wordlessly until they reached the beach. They left their bikes and shoes against a metal fence, ditching the still hot concrete as they walked onto the sand, cool and loose underneath their bare feet, burying their trail as they went. It was like they were sinking as they were walking, and it made a heavy cadence to their steps: down and forward, down and forward.</p>\n<p>“I saw a flock of avocets yesterday,” said Novalie.</p>\n<p>“Avocet?” asked Aneilia.</p>\n<p>“It’s a kind of bird. They aren’t supposed to be here in the summer, but they were circling the palm tree by the cafeteria.”</p>\n<p>“Where are they supposed to go?”</p>\n<p>“North, midwest actually.”</p>\n<p>The sand grew hard as they approached the water, their weight beginning to be met with some solidity, some give from the seawater, a slight buoyancy. Their cadence had quickened into fat slaps that propelled them forward. Above them, the night sky swam with constellations, but the moon was just a sliver.</p>\n<p>“Do they have a venereal term?” asked Aneilia.</p>\n<p>Novalie scrunched her face. “What’s that?”</p>\n<p>“It’s like when you say a pride of lions or like, a colony of ants,” said Aneilia.</p>\n<p>“No idea, probably not,” said Novalie.</p>\n<p>“It’s weird how some do and some don’t,” said Aneilia.</p>\n<p>They continued towards the pier, the tide coming in every once in a while to brush at their ankles, destroying the specific permutation of interchanging footprints left behind them. It was never really cold in Athens, but that night they shivered in the cold cast of starlight.</p>\n<p>Novalie shrugged. “Well, anyways, I was wondering if the avocets had anything to do with the Seabrights.”</p>\n<p>Aneilia’s steps slowed. “What’s that?”</p>\n<p>“I’ve been studying the coast for a while now, and I think there is something wrong with this beach,” Novalie continued. “Let me show you, it’s near the pier.”</p>\n<p>Novalie’s steps quickened and Aneilia matched her speed.</p>\n<p>“How would the birds have anything to do with the lights-” she whined.</p>\n<p>“Seabrights.” corrected Novalie.</p>\n<p>“Ok, Seabrights. What do the birds have to do with that?”</p>\n<p>Novalie appreciated Aneilia for going along with her small insistences.</p>\n<p>“It’s getting close to the solstice, which is also when the Seabrights reach their maximum illumination. And last year there was a group of beached whales the week before. Just weird crap like that,” said Novalie.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, weird shit,” Aneilia grinned, emphasizing the ‘t’ at the end of the word shit.</p>\n<p>Novalie couldn’t help but grin back.</p>\n<p>She continued, “When it first happened all kinds of rumors started – Navy practice drills, Russian surveillance, even… aliens.”</p>\n<p>Aneilia nodded slowly, her shoulders and neck bobbing up and down too. “What do <em>you</em> think it is?”</p>\n<p>Novalie squinted at the horizon swirling with black and navy. “The military base is too far from here… please don’t think I’m crazy, but I think it’s something extraterrestrial.”</p>\n<p>Aneilia and Novalie stopped beneath the pier, water at their ankles.</p>\n<p>“Anytime now,” she said. “There’ll be these rings of light, the brightest silver, and I swear, and it’s not an airplane or the moon, I see them every time I come here.”</p>\n<p>And so the two girls leaned against the wooden pillars, waiting for magic that never came. After half an hour of eager small talk, Aneilia shook her head.</p>\n<p>“Novalie, I don’t know if tonight is the night.”</p>\n<p>Novalie’s mouth twisted in one direction. “Come on, let’s wait a little longer.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t think it’s very nice of you to make up stories like this,” said Aneilia, “even if you were bored.”</p>\n<p>“I am not making shit up!” said Novalie. “I can’t believe the first time I try to show anybody they don’t come out. I swear–”</p>\n<p>“It’s okay,” said Aneilia.</p>\n<p>“Every other time!” Novalie said to herself.</p>\n<p>Aneila started to wade back towards the dry beach, the water having grown to their shins since they first got there.</p>\n<p>“Why would I be bored?” asked Novalie, calling after her. “Why did you say it like that?”</p>\n<p>Aneilia kept walking until she was completely out of the water before turning back. “Whatever. Ignore what I just said. Let’s return to our bikes.”</p>\n<p>Novalie followed slowly, her steps being the ones dragging behind Aneilia now. She knew the answer to her own question: Of course she was bored, there was nothing to do in Athens when you only had one friend.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>“She tried to show me the pier,” said Aneilia.</p>\n<p>Bill and Sue shared a look of concern. They were in a two car garage with one 2008 silver Toyota Corolla, leaving room for them to sit on the floor beside the car. This was where Aneilia slept.</p>\n<p>“Was any information compromised?” asked Sue.</p>\n<p>“No,” said Aneilia. “But I lied to her for the first time.”</p>\n<p>“Now <em>that</em> is a lie,” said Sue. “We are under disguise, our entire presence is dishonest.”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps she means in a more… direct way,” Bill pondered. He started to pat Aneilia’s lap with the back of his hand, palm up. “You are too sentimental,” and then after a pause: “What did she ask you?”</p>\n<p>“Did she ask if you were different?” pressed Sue.</p>\n<p>“No, she just asked what I thought about the ships,” said Aneilia. “She called them ‘Seabrights.’ Pretty name.”</p>\n<p>Bill nodded. “And how did her question make you think?” he asked.</p>\n<p>Novalie shook her head. “Humans lie all the time. But I think she was showing me something special, a secret… I feel…” she clutched her chest.</p>\n<p>“I find it worrisome that you are more concerned about her emotional safety than our security,” said Sue.</p>\n<p>“I have to agree with Sue here,” said Bill. “For our safety, and hers, you have to keep some distance.”</p>\n<p>Aneilia nodded, not saying anything else. Bill and Sue looked at each other again before getting up and going back in the house.</p>\n<p>“The dinner is too close to cancel. We will go through with it, but just be wary,” said Sue as she closed the door.</p>\n<p>They left Aneilia in the dank garage. She knew they were right. But earlier that night at the pier, she had felt a powerful tug in her new body, one of wanting to share something secret in return, a dangerous need to assert herself frankly. She remedied this unknown feeling welling up inside her by resting her eyes on what she knew best, her collection of bike parts pinned to the walls of the garage with nails. It was placed in such a fashion that it spiraled out from the middle of the wall, tires, gears and broken handlebars glued and roped and nailed together.</p>\n<p>She remembered the first time Novalie asked if she wanted to go biking, and she had spent half a week studying bikes, their history and mechanics. She went to the junkyard and compiled all the components of a bike from what she gleaned from <em>The Art of the Two Wheeled Beast</em> by Jean Wilder. She learned that the first wheel was made six thousand years ago but this slim device was only invented in the last two hundred. <em>How rudimentary</em>, she had thought as she observed the pieces, <em>yet wonderful</em>.</p>\n<p>But it was only until she got on the bike that Aneilia realized that no amount of studying could prepare her for the experiential aspect of the human bike. Novalie had watched on in horror as Aneilia veered straight into a ditch after ranting about the genius of shifting gears. She violently somersaulted off, slamming into the wet grass, staining her white polo shirt green.</p>\n<p>“Aneilia!” she had heard Novalie scream. Novalie ended up tripping off her bike trying to dismount on the side of the road, tumbling alongside her. “Are you okay?”</p>\n<p>Aneilia had never felt the body she was in so alive as it did when it was hurting; her knees stung from being scraped by the bike pedal, her abdomen ached from the impact, and her head throbbed. “I think I’m dying,” she had said, completely serious. “Internal bleeding.”</p>\n<p>As her head spun, Aneilia had thought Novalie had begun to malfunction too. A choking noise erupted from Novalie and Aneilia peered over to her, curious despite the pain. All of the liquids: the snot, saliva, and tears dripped down from Novalie’s cheeks as she shook from laughter. She was laughing! After a while, she said: “Trust me, you’re gonna be okay.”</p>\n<p>“You don’t know that,” said Aneilia. But as she protested she could already feel the pain in her stomach starting to subside.</p>\n<p>“Just say you don’t know how to bike,” said Novalie. She was still laughing, but it came out in more gentle tremors. “I can teach you.”</p>\n<p>Aneilia wiped off the blades of grass on her shirt. “I thought I did my research.”</p>\n<p>“I swear you seemed like you really loved biking,” said Novalie.</p>\n<p>“Just wait ’til I actually learn the way of the two wheeled beast.”</p>\n<p>Novalie had given Aneilia a curious look then, incredulous and in awe.</p>\n<p>That night, Novalie patiently held onto Aneilia’s handlebars to stabilize her bike for her to learn how to pedal. Aneilia felt that unknown feeling for the first time, an expanding cavern in her chest – something boundless like anarchy, which perhaps was just love.</p>\n<p>Now alone in the garage, Aneilia appreciated the deconstructed bike pieces pinned to the wall, taken out of their context and holding sentimental value. After Novalie taught her how, biking was indeed one of her favorite activities on the planet, along with prose poetry and bird watching. Aneilia touched the chain and gear hung closest to her, the grease blackening her fingers. It was something she thought humans would consider art.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Novalie saw Liv Burnman’s turquoise toenails above the water as she finished her lap in the pool. Liv was always late, but it didn’t matter because her times stayed the same: fast.</p>\n<p>“Hey Novalie,” said Liv out the side of her mouth, crouching down at the edge of the pool and dangling her feet in the water. She usually called her Mariam.</p>\n<p>“Hi Liv,” said Novalie. She wanted to get out of the pool and could feel her fingertips pruning, but she felt compelled to continue the conversation without interrupting. She took off her goggles and blinked forcefully, her legs kicking underneath to keep herself afloat as her elbows rested on the plastic grate at the side of the pool.</p>\n<p>“Coach said we are doing the medley relay with Riley and Anne,” said Liv.</p>\n<p>Novalie nodded. “Cool.”</p>\n<p>“You’re pretty fast,” said Liv. “How do you do it?”</p>\n<p>“What do you mean?” said Novalie. “You’re our best swimmer.”</p>\n<p>“Ha, thanks,” said Liv. And then after a pause: “But I mean with school.”</p>\n<p>“What?”</p>\n<p>“How do you also get good grades?”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, well,” Novalie thought about the comfort assignments gave her, a fat red A at the top of an exam, “My mom wants me to be a good student.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, I’m sure she does,” said Liv. “You know, Mr. Langley tells me if I don’t get him my essay by Friday he won’t let me pass his class.”</p>\n<p>Novalie finally knew where the conversation was going. “Do you want me to take a look at your essay?” she asked.</p>\n<p>Liv averted Novalie’s gaze. “Yeah sure, that would be really great actually.”</p>\n<p>Novalie pulled herself up and out of the water. As they sat side by side, Novalie’s arm brushed against Liv’s. Liv scooted away immediately but Novalie didn’t notice.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, also I’m having a party at my house before the formal. Riley and Anne are coming too,” she said. “You are free to join us.”</p>\n<p>Novalie swished her legs in the water, trying to contain her excitement. “I’ll ask my mom,” she said. She immediately regretted her lame response. “Could Aneilia come too?”</p>\n<p>Liv made a face as if she had just tasted something awful. “Aneilia? Oh yeah you guys sit at lunch together. I don’t know, she’s a little…” Liv made the face again.</p>\n<p>Novalie nodded slowly. “Right, yeah that’s fine.”</p>\n<p>Liv shrugged. “You guys are different. Aneilia, the way she asks questions, it’s kind of … alarming, right?”</p>\n<p>Novalie nodded again.</p>\n<p>“Like, you know how things <em>are</em>, and I like that. Maybe even quiet or mysterious. At first I thought Aneilia was cool, but she’s just kinda annoying. She doesn’t seem to really get it…” Liv couldn’t find the right words to finish her thought.</p>\n<p>Novalie felt herself standing up to go. Liv’s assertion of her tacit acceptance made her want to hurl.</p>\n<p>“I think my mom will probably be here soon to pick me up,” she said as she walked towards the locker room.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, just don’t forget my essay,” hollered Liv.</p>\n<p>“Yup, I’ll get it to you by Thursday, that way you can revise it so–” said Novalie, but her response was swallowed by a splash; Liv had already dived head first into the pool.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Novalie and her mother ended up deciding on the blue sundress that pinched at Novalie’s armpits and a neat bun that her mother laboriously wrestled her hair up into. But meeting Aneilia’s parents, Novalie now knew it was pointless to have spent that much time putting herself together. The Otts were not like the other white families in town.</p>\n<p>Aneilia Ott’s parents had unnaturally narrow shoulders and normal-sized heads. Their small torso-to-leg ratio made it seem that they were floating above the dinner table, bobbleheads with giant knives in their left hands and chopsticks in their right. They communicated with each other with sideways glances and small chin twitches that made Novalie feel like she was watching an intricate dance between two rodents relaying important information – an encroaching coyote, a hawk circling, a human trying to smoke them out. She watched them eat their lasagna like little field mice and tried to hide her judgment. When Aneilia returned to the table, Novalie let out a long, secret exhale and unclasped the strand of hair she had been fiddling with.</p>\n<p>“Here,” said Aneilia, placing four glowering oranges onto the table, all from the fruit basket Novalie brought as a present.</p>\n<p>Novalie grabbed the one farthest away from her.</p>\n<p>“Why did you pick that one?” asked Aneilia. Aneilia’s voice was always louder when she was asking a question.</p>\n<p>“Don’t be so abrasive Nellie, people pick things for arbitrary reasons all the time,” said Aneilia’s mom. Her voice was always the same volume, right above a whisper. “It’s quite ru–”</p>\n<p>“Why did you pick that one?” persisted Aneilia.</p>\n<p>Novalie was always taken aback by her curiosity but she liked it when Aneilia asked questions like this. Eighth grade had been better because as it happened she had Aneilia to explain it to. “Because it’s the least smooth, look at its rough skin, that means it’ll be easy to peel, which means there has been enough time for the fruit to sweeten.”</p>\n<p>“So if an orange is hard to peel, is it safe to assume that it will be more acidic?” asked Aneilia, emphasizing the word acidic.</p>\n<p>“Not necessarily, but it’s a safe guess. Just means there is more water content, if it’s hard to peel and sweet, that means it’s juicier too.”</p>\n<p>Aneilia smiled. “Everything is related to water.”</p>\n<p>Each of the Otts picked up an orange and started peeling them. They ate a slice of their orange and then silently exchanged slices, doing this multiple times and murmuring about the peel-to-sweetness ratios, ranking them precisely.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a good heuristic, Novalie. But these two have indistinguishable sweetness while the peels are the same,” said Aneilia’s dad, holding up two halves of oranges. He turned to Novalie. “Thank you. You are instrumental.”</p>\n<p>Novalie smiled and nodded, her initial fears of meeting Aneilia’s family, even though she was the one begging to visit the big house at the end of the culdesac, were quelled, swallowed by a bigger relief of acceptance.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Puberty had clutched Novalie at the age of thirteen and that night she woke up to the feeling of her breasts swelling in the Floridian heat. In her semi-dark room, she stared at the gradient rings of water damage on her ceiling left by the negligent upstairs neighbors and imagined it as a topography map of an unknown land.</p>\n<p>She listened unwillingly to her mother in the next room on the phone with her dad; it was morning in Shanghai. Some of the words she could pick out: <em>fang wu bao xian</em>, home insurance; <em>zui jin xin wen</em>, the recent news; <em>xiao jiu lai yue jing le</em>, Little Jiu got her first period. Her dad started the arguing, his voice harsh and made harsher from the distortion of the phone, something about tampons being bad for girls, and her mom retorting that she was on the swim team so it was a necessary evil.</p>\n<p>Novalie began hallucinating the chlorine from the pool, the air around her coalescing into a viscous mixture she was now floating in. She loved to swim. The sport was all motion and senses – moving through water, she could feel the proportions of her power with each stroke. Her coach called her stone face but Novalie thought her face betrayed her all the time. But nobody noticed; they only saw her when she won something, when she was finally at the podium. Aneilia did though. She would be the one to wait for her in the locker room, wrap a towel around her shoulders and ask her about her favorite distance to swim.</p>\n<p>Novalie wiped the sweat collected in the divet between her nose and her cheek. With her blanket on the floor, there was nothing more she could do except take her shirt off. She did, but a pang of shame made her put it back on.</p>\n<p>The streetlight outside their apartment buzzed synchronously with the katydids, and she confused their rhythm for her own heartbeat. Something about dinner at Aneilia’s home had made her want to throw away all of her Seabright photographs. Images of oranges floated to the surface, the creamy insides of the peel, Aneilia’s parents’ mousy chatter, their wide eyes, their shared extreme curiosity.</p>\n<p>Nobody in Athens would have been able to figure it out, except Novalie, who was not repulsed enough, who was perhaps more similar than different.</p>\n<p>Novalie’s breath quickened, until she became suspicious of it. But there were benefits to living in the half-basement apartment – it was good for escape.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>“Can I show you something?” asked Aneilia.</p>\n<p>“Oh yeah?”</p>\n<p>Somewhere in Athens, Florida, eighth graders were partying with Liv Burnam before their disco-jubilee. But not Novalie or Aneilia.</p>\n<p>They were biking again.</p>\n<p>Strangely, Novalie knew that Aneilia was still deciding if she should show her anything at all. So she stayed extra quiet. When they got to a big willow tree, they stopped and laid their bikes in the tall grass. A faint smile grew on Aneilia’s face.</p>\n<p>“It’s something I wrote.”</p>\n<p>Novalie just nodded, afraid to change Aneilia’s mind.</p>\n<p>Aneilia pulled out a journal, its cover a collage of disc shaped objects: buttons, bottlecaps, and nickels. It reminded Novalie of the bottom of her desk.</p>\n<p>Her eyes were still and honest. Normally the color of water, they were shining now. Strands of hair framed her face, trembling slightly. She paused again before starting to read, her voice faint.</p>\n<p>“The sky negotiated with the water, and I landed silently on the foam. I was given new layers to wear, bound to me in a flash of light. I breathed in the salt, pollen, and fish. I said each of these words out loud to myself, feeling my mouth warp and react to the air, casting feeble vibrations out into this vast, foreign kingdom. My tongue ached and I craved to know the names of things. My eyes stumbled at the ferocity of light and I shivered at the new system of colors laid out before me. I knew what all of them were called but did not know which one was which. I was spinning, nauseous. But when my bones and muscles heaved and braced to steady me, I was pleased. I looked down and said to myself: these are my hands, my nails. I touched this body I have now, the skin softer than I expected, the organ meant to resist the world around it elastic and pliable. They were here with me too, both taller. I was the one given the chance to start completely new, here. We stepped in towards the beach, noisy waves at our knees, their crashes welcoming.”</p>\n<p>Aneilia looked up at her friend, who couldn’t help but smile at Aneilia, a secret buried exquisitely between them.</p>\n<p>“Thanks,” she whispered into the night.</p>\n</div>","title_display":"From Distant Shores","group":"writing"},"crows-mouth":{"page":"<div class=story>\n\t\t<h2>Crow’s Mouth</h2>\n\t\t<span class=story-date>October 2023</span>\n\t\t<hr><p>I dream of her killing herself frequently. She crouches, her shoulder blades drawn back as she leans over the edge of the high-rise that used to be our vegetable garden. Her body is arced with tension; she is about to spring forth, open her arms in rapture and glide through a sliver of the horizon – swirling, deep, and orange. I believe that she can fly and I grin because I have always known that she was destined for great things. That is the faith daughters have in mothers. I feel suspended with her as she leaps, with pleasure and without thinking. But she plummets instead. In my sleep I am still not sure if we are two different people or the same person. I am falling with her just as I am watching. When I wake, shaking her residue off like cold dew, I become lucid and fraught with grim implications – that the hole I left in her was so complete and unshakable I had begun to imagine us doing horrible things to ourselves.</p>\n<p>This year was the same. I had left a crack open in my window the night before and the cold rush of morning traffic woke me. The downwardness of my mother’s leap lingered at my temples. I rubbed at my eyelids and I finally remembered to exhale, a hot breath escaping me as if I had been holding it in all night. I turned onto my belly and reached into my pillowcase to remove a red envelope, the paper so soft from age it had the texture of a handkerchief. From it I pulled out a tuft of hair. She had cut it from my head when I was born. I imagined her patting my baby scalp and deciding selfishly to save some of it for herself. I must have inherited that selfishness because when I left Taipei I fumbled through her drawers and took it with me. I had paused over her jade bangle and emergency cash, slightly nauseous from the smell of mothballs, but I left those there. It felt good to just take a piece of me she had kept. Looking at my own limp hair, I ran the strands through my fingers. They were soft like dawn. I brought them to my nose and inhaled but I couldn't smell anything.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>It all started with a television set. I told my mother that my best friend Gao Wen had a new flatscreen at her house. My mother was frying an egg and she paused in her swift movements. Her hair, long and black to her hips, swung subtly back and forth.</p>\n<p>“Why do you need a TV?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“I never said that, I just thought it was cool,” I replied. “We watched a nature documentary on it and the lizard looked like it was about to jump out of the screen!”</p>\n<p>She laughed lightly and flipped the egg in the pan. She had painted her nails pink the day before at work and they matched her slippers. When I had asked her if her boss cared that she was doing her nails at the front desk, she just shrugged. Her pale hands moved in and out of the morning light, catching glints that sharpened the pink to a red. She used to paint them that color. Until I told her my favorite color was pink when I was ten. Soon after everything we owned became that color — pink radio on the window still, matching pink bathrobes, pink soap. When I started liking purple more I was afraid to tell her.</p>\n<p>The door to the kitchen creaked open. It was my grand-uncle; we were living in his house at the time. He moved slowly, almost imperceptibly, but his eyes were still quick with life and I could see him calculating, adding up the money he got every month from his pension and tenants.</p>\n<p>“Er Shu Shu!” my mother said, rushing to help him to a seat. He was almost deaf and did not hear her, his eyes whirling around in panic as she approached him from the side. The egg started burning. She was too frugal with the oil. I got up and turned off the stove, sliding the egg from the pan and onto a plate.</p>\n<p>“Where is Maria?” my mother fumed. Maria was the nurse from Indonesia my uncle hired to take care of his dad. “They are paying her, not me!”</p>\n<p>“I saw on the news that there was some flash flooding last night, maybe something happened?” I said.</p>\n<p>“Don’t be a crow’s mouth!” my mother gently slapped me on the wrist. “God, I hope she gets here soon.”</p>\n<p>I stayed quiet. Crow’s mouth was when someone mentions a possible unlucky event, superstition goes that it will actually come true. It was my mother’s greatest pet peeve.</p>\n<p>Maria arrived in a couple of minutes as I was scooping congee into our bowls.</p>\n<p>“I’m so sorry, they had to close some of the lanes,” she said, her Chinese slow and broken.</p>\n<p>“It’s Ok-la,” my mother chimed. “Safety first, take your time.”</p>\n<p>I set the bowls on the table. Maria hungrily eyed the bowls and I looked down guiltily. My mother was strict about food in the house. She’s being paid in money, not food and drink, she’d always say. I secretly disagreed, it wasn’t <em>her</em> money.</p>\n<p>“Oh shoot, I still haven’t washed my face yet,” my mother said, fanning her face. That was code for: I haven’t done my makeup yet. She sat down and skimmed the top of her bowl of congee with her chopsticks. I watched as she got up, having sat down for not even a full minute, headed to her room.</p>\n<p>“You can give this to Bao Luo,” she said.</p>\n<p>Bao Luo was our alleyway dog. Today was another lucky day for him.</p>\n<p>I sighed as she left. The steam of her unfinished congee abstracted the beaded curtain leading to the back room, where Maria fussed over my grand-uncle; she was slow but gentle. I ate quickly so that the food wouldn’t go cold.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Gao Wen and I were not quite delinquents, but we were surely not on any teacher’s favorites list. Nobody expected big things from us. There was a small “waterfall” behind our school which was essentially a 10 foot dam with a steel pipe that sputtered out water into a small pond. We thought it was the most magical place in the world. We found it in the beginning of middle school but went there less and less frequently.</p>\n<p>We still upheld the tradition of going right before exams. We felt like kids again, casting spells with twigs and prodding at the mud on the banks of the pond. It was a good release from constant test prep classes that ran late into the night.</p>\n<p>I remember the day before finals in our last year of high school, when we sat on the rocks under the dam, our schoolgirl skirts were speckled by the water from the pipe. Light filtered in through the fresh leaves, still glossy and unabashed in their newness. I yearned for a more expansive canopy, for the exams to be over and summer to arrive. Gao Wen was quiet in her ways, and she relied on games and good questions to mediate conversations.</p>\n<p>“Would you rather be a princess or a witch?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“Witch!” I said quickly. “I want to be able to cast spells!”</p>\n<p>Gao Wen replied that she would want to be a princess. “There are more people to keep me company in a castle. Witches live alone.”</p>\n<p>I thought about this. “But you’ll be powerful enough to get whatever you want, isn’t that better?”</p>\n<p>Gao Wen shrugged. “What else could I want? I’d be a princess.”</p>\n<p>I waved my arms in exasperation. An idea strikes: “You could get as much mango shaved ice as you want.”</p>\n<p>Gao Wen considers this. “Tempting… but I feel like if I were a princess people would just bring it to me if I asked.”</p>\n<p>I rolled my eyes. “Ok, be your princess.”</p>\n<p>I decided to stand up and leave Gao Wen on the rocks as I looked for crawling critters in the pond water. I knew it made her nervous but that was kind of the point.</p>\n<p>“Have you seen the kid from America?” Gao Wen asked.</p>\n<p>“Oh the one with the hair as yellow as straw?” I said, a little louder than my normal voice so that she could still hear.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, Mai-chal,” Gao Wen said.</p>\n<p>“He is really quiet, I guess his Chinese isn’t really good.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah,” said Gao Wen. “He’s teaching me some English.”</p>\n<p>I could tell she was debating whether or not to reveal more information. I stayed quiet. “He said he was returning to America after classes ended. But he has two really young siblings. His parents are looking for a nanny that speaks Chinese.”</p>\n<p>I felt my eyes grow wide. “Did he ask you?”</p>\n<p>“He did, but he also asked if I knew anybody who would want to do it if I couldn’t.”</p>\n<p>Things like this just happened to Gao Wen. I feigned nonchalance, pretending to find something interesting in the water.</p>\n<p>“You should do it,” I suggested.</p>\n<p>“No no, my parents would never let me. I’m supposed to go to college here,” she said. “Plus, a new place is so scary and I would hate it there. My English isn’t <em>that</em> good.”</p>\n<p>I shrugged having done my due diligence as the encouraging, adventurous friend.</p>\n<p>“But maybe you should go,” said Gao Wen. “I told him about you and he said your English is better than mine.”</p>\n<p>“Why would you do that before asking me?” I asked. “Why would you just assume that I would want to go?”</p>\n<p>“You don’t like it here, you’re the class poet, you’re the dreamer,” said Gao Wen. She suddenly got up, animated. She mimicked the Statue of Liberty, torch in hand. “Come to the land of dreams!”</p>\n<p>I wagged my head, but was secretly flattered, even hopeful.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Later that month I came back from tutoring to find a brand new television on the coffee table. It was sleek and shiny, completely out of place against our wicker sofa with cushions rotting from humidity. Even the smell of the room shifted with the arrival of this sci-fi looking apparatus – a tinge more plastic. I stood there in disbelief.</p>\n<p>“Ma…” I hollered. “How did you get this?”</p>\n<p>No response, so I decided she was at work and I started dinner. Our fridge stank from the volume of leftovers, all in black containers stacked and anonymous. I fumbled through them, smelling carefully before deciding to give it to Bao Luo or to heat it up in a pan. It was only until the food was piled up on the table that I thought something was amiss.</p>\n<p>Her room was in the little studio above my grand uncle’s garage. To get there I had to cross the alleyway between it and the main house, one of the last surviving one-story buildings on the busy Taipei street.</p>\n<p>May in the city was alive with the sound of motorcycles and bugs as the smoke of late night grills pulsed through the air in waves. Vines snaked across the house’s walls and small violet flowers, looking surreal in bluish security light lighting bloomed in explosive bursts. The staircase from the garage to her room was narrow and lopsided. I hated going up there.</p>\n<p>I opened the door and found her sleeping feverishly. Her bed was under a bright pink mosquito tent and through it, moonlight casted a white glow onto her brow.</p>\n<p>“What happened?” I said to myself.</p>\n<p>Her room was a mess. Fake luxury perfumes and designer bags lined every wall, a thin path spiraled from the door to her bed and desk amidst the clutter of wigs and make up and magazines. I went to her desk and found a stack of papers. Apart from the rest of her room, those papers seemed sterile and alert. There were numbers and graphs and signatures, but the words that stood out were <em>blood plasma donation</em>. I immediately grew red and embarrassed. In the sweet stink of her room, I wanted to unzip the mosquito tent over her bed and throw the papers in her face.</p>\n<p>“I must’ve lost track of time,” I heard her grumble.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t ask for a TV,” I said.</p>\n<p>“I know, but isn’t it so nice!” a lazy smile appeared on her face as if she was still dreaming. “You were right, the people look so real on the big screen.”</p>\n<p>“You lied on this. You can’t be doing this twice a week. You’ll die,” I said.</p>\n<p>“Crow’s mouth!” We stared at each other as she slowly realized that I was still angry, and that made her even angrier. “I should change your name and call you little crow. Do you want me to die?”</p>\n<p>The accusation burned me. Instead of answering I count the number of acrylic nails on the ground. There were seven.</p>\n<p>“What does Er Shu Shu think?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“Don’t try to use him against me.” She narrowed her eyes. “You are never grateful.”</p>\n<p>She said the word never with so much finality I felt my heart slam up against something in my chest. She decided to add, “I saw him watching the news on it earlier. He <em>loves</em> it.”</p>\n<p>I nodded to myself. I felt silly, my head bobbing up and down in my mother’s dollhouse room, trying to love a flatscreen TV.</p>\n<p>“How was work?”</p>\n<p>Her acidity subsided and she returned to her childlike grin. She stretched her arms out, her dainty wrists adorned in silly bracelets. <em>Completely immature!</em> My eyes wandered down to the scars on the insides of her elbows. I imagined her smiling politely in the hospital as they stabbed her, again and again. I felt sick. I felt a weight that would never be lifted because of how much she loved me.</p>\n<p>“No more work for me, I quit,” she said.</p>\n<p>My shock quickly subsided. This was a common occurrence.</p>\n<p>“What? So we can watch TV?” I said.</p>\n<p>“Don’t worry about it.” She got up from bed and paced towards me, stepping on an eyelash curler and wincing. I winced with her. She put her hands around my arms and examined me. I was so much more tanner than her, and I smelled of kitchen fire. A smile rippled across her face. “I’d get anything for you.”</p>\n<p>That night we fell asleep on the wicker sofa. I woke in the middle of the night and watched the unnatural colors from the TV screen light up my mother's beautiful face. I turned my attention to the screen, rubbing my eyes and feeling my eyelids crunch. I tried to blink my eyes back into clarity, but I failed. All sound grew faint, even the passing of traffic became just a murmur. I felt the back of my shoulders glued to my seat as my eyes stayed open. The screen before me expanded, images turned to pure color as my mother and I and the wicker sofa were absorbed by a sea of neon green. From the noise I saw myself, or a silhouette of me, emerge from a puddle of red, as red as my mother’s pink nails in harsh morning light. My clone walked towards my mother and put her face beside hers. I watched on as this static version of me melted into her. I could no longer differentiate the two. My mother’s skin became static, the curves of her chin and neck obscured by noise. I blinked again and I was inside this half mother, half television monster, the world a grainy, rainbow mess. All I knew was that we were one and the same. The two of us, all three of us. We were the same. I was paralyzed and I could feel my stomach twisting into knots, and then those knots folding onto themselves. I was positive that I was going to vomit. That was when I decided to leave home with Michael’s family to America.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>A decade later, I stare at a bright LED screen in a shop window. I am at the Prudential Center because it is still frigid in Boston and there is not much to do except to wander around indoor malls, deciding what I cannot afford. On the TVs they are playing stock footage of ginkgo trees. The camera moves up and down tiny golden fans.</p>\n<p>They never told me how she died, just that she was found cold in her bed two months after I left. It could have been the blood donations. But it also could have been me. That winter I saw my first snowfall in America and the world grew quiet, insulated by a soft, white cocoon. I wore my clothes from Taiwan in awkward layers as I felt the retraction of all life around me. I became mute for a long time. The snow on the outside crept inside me and any sound I tried to make was absorbed by it. The children I was supposed to take care of tugged at me, asking for their juice boxes, for me to read them stories about fairies and dragons, for the right pronunciation for home in Chinese. Their neediness rescued me and I began saving my money like it was water and I was crossing a desert. I put myself through school. I did hard things. All the while I would browse plane tickets to Taiwan ever so often, punishing myself. I haven’t been back. Instead, I watch her fall in my dreams, and I wake up smelling my baby hair wishing it was hers.</p>\n<p>I look back at the screens of endless fields of ginkgo, their branches wildly intersecting and then shooting off and then intersecting again. I could smell perfume from department stores, so alike to hers in their dizzying effect. The TVs buzz with energy, an energy I had been paralyzed by before. I remember hearing that gingko leaves fall all at once. It was as if the trees heard me thinking through the screen. They fall instantly, and the dead leaves now morph into someone I could touch. Maybe it was her from my dreams. She approached me and sighed. Her exhalation washed over me, so bright that I blinked through my tears, concentrating on my own small palms so as not to be blinded. We were finally two different people. I felt myself wrapped in pixelated gold. I have not been warm like this in a long time. She reached out and touched my face, reminded me of the power of leaving, forgave me for it, and then beckoned me home. I called Gao Wen that night.</p>\n</div>","title_display":"Crow’s Mouth","group":"writing"},"conversations-with-a-phantom-piano":{"page":"<div class=story>\n\t\t<h2>Conversations with a Phantom Piano</h2>\n\t\t<span class=story-date>Spring 2023</span>\n\t\t<hr><p>Anya sits on the piano bench. There was no piano, but she runs her fingers along imaginary keys anyways. There are broken skylight windows above her, and from them, light shoots down white and harsh, making a splintery mess. Her fingers dance and she sways a little with them, her knuckles coming in and out of the skylight’s illumination. She isn’t pressing the keys — she is swimming through them, as if ripping the instrument apart to make a new kind of music.</p>\n<p>It is a warm day. Small birds peck at the grass growing where the walls meet the earth. The space had lost its interior timbre, all of the ghosts having escaped through the cracks of the concrete walls. It used to be a high school cafeteria, back before schools integrated. This was the colored school that got shut down. Now, forest sounds permeate the air. Things have settled for the last time. Anya settles too, her piece over. She can hear the Huntingdon kids creeping in, wearing their dress pants and plaid skirts, white button downs ironed by their grandmas and nannies. She moves to a corner obscured by tall rusty carts that would make a lot of sound if knocked over.</p>\n<p>“This is our kingdom,” the girl with the short hair says. Anya knows that her name is Heather Smith. She can see her shuffling around the rubble along with the other two kids, a bunch of dandelions limp in her coat pocket.</p>\n<p>“Are you the king? Are we your subjects?” asks the tall boy — Rory. He was probably the one who picked the dandelions.</p>\n<p>Heather reaches out her hand. Her slender arm makes the perfect line from her shoulder to her fingertips. Rory bends down, smelling her skin; he kisses her hand. Anya cannot imagine being touched in such an open way.</p>\n<p>Dash, the short boy, his name short for Richard Dashner, shakes his head to himself. “Rory be careful, I swear if she tells you to jump off a bridge all you’ll do is ask how high.”</p>\n<p>Heather snorts. Rory is unfazed. “That’s so silly Dash, I wouldn’t ask questions. I’d just jump.”</p>\n<p>Dash shakes his head in disbelief. They sit on the ground, Heather and Rory back to back, reading two copies of the same book. Anya likes the sliver of space between their lower part of their backs, light streaming through them and around them. She thinks they look like a pair of wings. Dash lays out flat beside Rory with his own book lying face down between pages on his chest. He lights a cigarette and starts sucking it. Anya watches the puffs of grey escape his mouth, irregular shapes that expand until they disappear. She knows, that even watching him from a distance, she could watch his mouth moving forever, lopsided, like he was hiding something in its asymmetry.</p>\n<p>“What are you reading?” asked Heather suddenly. Rory looks inquisitively at his book which was the same as hers, but then realizes the question was directed at Dash. Dash takes a second to realize this too. He turns his head up to the side.</p>\n<p>“Crime and Punishment,” he says.</p>\n<p>“Thinking about murdering anybody recently and then embarking a quest of moral quandary?” says Heather</p>\n<p>“Ha! Why would I kill anyone? There’s no need,” replies Dash.</p>\n<p>“Well that’s only if you get caught. Doesn’t the guy in the book never get caught?” asks Rory.</p>\n<p>“To be simply put, I don’t think I’d pull it off,” says Dash. “Also, he totally gets caught. I’m at that part now.”</p>\n<p>“I think someone pulled it off quite recently,” says Rory.</p>\n<p>His words hit Dash’s brows. Anya sees every tendon in his body tighten.</p>\n<p>“That girl with the glasses. Some unique trailer trash,” continues Rory. “Can’t even drive.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know what Dr. Palmer saw in her, letting her come to Huntingdon. I’ll admit, she can play the piano … but nobody knew what was going on in that big head of hers,” says Heather.</p>\n<p>Dash stays quiet but exaggeratedly opens his book, obscuring his face from Anya — the world. He begins reading and and the three are submerged up to their shoulders in silence.</p>\n<p>The ground Anya sits on is damp. She can feel the water going through her jeans, her underwear. But she likes the coolness in the dark corner, seeming to have been there for ages. It felt safe. Anya scoots against the wall, feels the dampness spread across her shoulder blades. She closes her eyes.</p>\n<p><i>What piece were you playing?</i></p>\n<p>Nothing in particular.</p>\n<p><i>What was the song?</i></p>\n<p>There wasn’t a song.

That hurts!</i></p>\n<p>You’re not even real.</p>\n<p><i>Hmph…</i></p>\n<p><i>…What does your body remember?</i></p>\n<p>My eyes, they remember how they were pierced as I exited the dimly lit store and out into the parking lot. I could feel the heat from the pavement through my sandals as I padded to my car.  My lips still wet from kissing. I remember the metal of my car door stinging my skin.  My nose remembers the smell of piss. I can feel him between my arms, his skin lifeless in dead air.</p>\n<p><i>And he was the one you taught to play?</i></p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p><i>Was he good?</i></p>\n<p>He was ok, he always asked me for skittles after our lesson. He had a raspy little voice. He liked scales, hated chords. His hands were too small.</p>\n<p><i>So he died.</i></p>\n<p>Yes, but that was not the worst part.</p>\n<p><i>How could it get any worse that that?</i></p>\n<p>Things always get worse. Especially when you think you hit rock bottom.</p>\n<p><i>But how do you get to ‘rock bottom’? Do you fall, do you lower yourself gently?</i></p>\n<p>Maybe. It’s interesting that you say “lower yourself”. I thought it wasn’t something you can get to yourself, but a combination of external factors. But I think it is very possible to self-inflict. So you know the concept of up and down?</p>\n<p><i>Yes. Up is silence, down is the opposite of that. Down is melodic. Down is pressure — presence, solid.</i></p>\n<p>Then imagine rock bottom as infinite sound, like that siren that rang after the worst finally happened, the siren that would stay in my ears the days after. It’s so solid it’s like a giant finger pressing on your chest.</p>\n<p><i>Anya. We must start at the beginning, the bottom is where the answers are. But I do not know the questions.</i></p>\n<p>Yes, we must start at the beginning.</p>\n<p><i>The answers are infinite, but they converge at the question, at the beginning. Yes, let’s go there, to the beginning.</i></p>\n<p>I no longer think about the beginning, because it makes me feel the passing seconds so much more. I am hurting every second. I am being dug into. I will not be forgiven.</p>\n<p><i>what is it to be forgiven?</i></p>\n<p>It’s when you tell someone that wronged you that you have processed it and that you accept them as a person.</p>\n<p><i>So they can’t accept you. You feel like you’ve been exiled.</i></p>\n<p>I think they don’t want to process it either. It’s beyond the realm of things they want to deal with. They have other things to worry about.</p>\n<p><i>Like what?</i></p>\n<p>Cruises. Business deals. Their pet tigers. The kids are now thinking about prom. What dress to wear. The girls with curly hair want their hair straightened, the girls with straight hair want their hair curled.</p>\n<p><i>I still don’t understand.</i></p>\n<p>What?</p>\n<p><i>Why do you need to be forgiven?</i></p>\n<p>Because I can’t go on feeling like I owe those people, who I already owed so much to, I am knee deep in indebtedness. I can’t believe the moral superiority that boiled underneath my skin, when I have done an irrevocable act. And they don’t even know the truth.</p>\n<p><i>This must have something to do with the song you’ve been playing.</i></p>\n<p>Maybe.</p>\n<p><i>I need to know the song.</i></p>\n<p>Ok. The beginning?</p>\n<p><i>Yes, Anya. Let’s start there.</i></p>\n<p>I guess it would have to start with Dr. Palmer. He approached me after my first recital when we got to Georgia, he said I should apply to Huntingdon. That I was too good for public school. His hair was oiled and he smelled like pine trees. He told me and my mom that he thought I was an angel and that he actually liked my hair.</p>\n<p>“It’s so black and shiny?!” he had noted.</p>\n<p>My mom was so relieved someone wanted to talk to us, she may have nodded too vigorously. I noticed that he was annoyed with her, her eagerness. I secretly laughed at her in my head too because I hated how she wanted to be a part of something so badly. Like our family wasn’t enough for her, she had to be in a continuous state of expansion. She consumed so much, she kept up with everything —  the latest fashion, beauty products, omega-3 supplements, after school programs for gifted kids. My mom is the kind of mom that spent a whole day cleaning when she heard guests were coming over. I thought it was stupid. No matter how much you clean a trailer you’re still in a trailer. She would sit on the sofa across from the keyboard when I played and take notes. And then she would make me play in front of her friends. She felt entitled to it, my talent. A flick of her wrist pulled me out of whatever I was doing and onto the piano bench.</p>\n<p><i>But you like playing piano, no?</i></p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p><i>So it’s thanks to her.</i></p>\n<p>Well, not for a while. For a while I hated it. But I guess if we’re talking about beginnings she is the start of everything. My life. My pain. My love.</p>\n<p><i>So that is what I am made of, your pain and love. Tell me about Dash.</i></p>\n<p>Nobody talked to me at Huntingdon about anything other than me performing at their aunt’s wedding or how good I was at playing piano. But the first time I met Dash he told me my glasses were crooked.</p>\n<p><i>Were they?</i></p>\n<p>Yes. He’s very honest.</p>\n<p><i>Do you find honesty important?</i></p>\n<p>I don’t know. I don’t think my mom strived for me to have an honest personality. I’ve been building something inside me.</p>\n<p><i>What have you been building?</i></p>\n<p>This wall, I can’t be myself no matter how hard I try. I am either on the wall looking down at people, or I’m down below with this insurmountable thing before me. No matter how hard I try I am falling from the top but simultaneously stuck at the bottom. Condescending yet immobile.</p>\n<p><i>What does Dash have to do with this?</i></p>\n<p>I was answering your question about honesty.</p>\n<p><i>But this isn’t about that either, is it?</i></p>\n<p>Yeah isn’t that what life is? Extrapolating meaning from meaninglessness. If you do it too much it hurts.</p>\n<p><i>Extrapolate it.</i></p>\n<p>What?</p>\n<p><i>What does Dash have to do with the wall?</i></p>\n<p>He was like a gate. I could go through the wall if I was with him. He lent me books. He would kiss me on the cheek. In a soft kind of way.</p>\n<p><i>But?</i></p>\n<p>But…but he only kissed me in the one corner of the library that no one could see. He didn’t let me talk to Rory or Heather. I was like his…</p>\n<p><i>His pet?</i></p>\n<p>Well, that’s an exaggeration. The problem was probably just that I thought about him too much.</p>\n<p><i>Anya, you’re not making sense. How do we get to the car and the piss?</i></p>\n<p>Dash let me borrow his camera, for an art project. I decided that I would go around the rich suburban homes and take pictures of them. I was a fan of bird baths and garden gnomes.</p>\n<p>I had been staying up pretty late. I was memorizing so many pieces at that time. I was a walking gramophone. I knew all the cheesy wedding pieces, like Canon in D. I could play that one in my sleep. There was also the kid I was teaching piano to at that time. Louis. He had fat cheeks, cherub-like. His pale face was always slightly flushed, either from running outside or from napping way too long. His mom treated him like a teddy bear, her tight embrace following him wherever he went. She was the President of the Garden Bookclub, and my mom delegated me with the task of teaching Louis piano with the hope that she would eventually be invited to join the ensemble of rich housewives.</p>\n<p><i>Was she?</i></p>\n<p>No. I don’t think they even talk to her anymore, not after what happened.</p>\n<p>It was the Sunday before the week the project was due, and I headed out early to take the pictures.</p>\n<p>The trailer was quiet. It was a long box with linoleum surfaces and uneven floors. But the floors were always clean. I like walking barefoot on them, feeling the protrusions and divots beneath me. Dawn crept in through the plastic blinders and spilled onto the surfaces, drawing yellow hemispheres over the countertops. I grabbed the camera and took the car. I thought I would be back by noon so my mother wouldn’t notice.</p>\n<p>The first house I went to was modern and painted black. It had blue shutters and abstract statues that looked like ginormous columns of seaweed. I could see a young family through the crystal clear window, toys spilled over a carpeted floor, a woman dressed her Sunday best. I snapped a picture and moved on.</p>\n<p>I kept walking down the street, some houses were more traditional looking, stone walls and castle-like. I come across this green house shrouded by trees. I notice the outline of what seemed to be a giant bird between the crossing branches. I wanted to get a closer look so I walked along the white fence on the edge of the yard. I knew I was trespassing, but I thought that whoever lived there might be already at church, so there was no harm. I would just get the picture and go.</p>\n<p>But then I saw. It was the Huntingdon kids. Rory and Heather and some other people I didn’t know but would snicker at me in the hallways. They were surrounded by beasts. That huge bird, rainbow and magnificent. Tigers, zebras, peacocks. The animals seemed subdued, completely tame, while the kids pulled at their fur and ears, little gods in a garden of eden. Some music was playing in the background, faint but pulsing; and the flora matched the fauna with its vigor and exoticism. Fans of green, blossoms of pink, primordial vines, all draped on the big chestnut trees over a perfectly kept lawn. It didn’t smell like animals, instead, an intoxicating fragrance permeated the air.</p>\n<p>I looked at their tea cups. And I swear—</p>\n<p><i>What?</i></p>\n<p>There were bones in them. Small bones.</p>\n<p>I stood there, feeling like the dumbest person in the world, and then I snapped a picture. Right then, Anya must have noticed me because I remember her raising her perfect hand, admonishing me. I felt a crackling in my temples and I turned and ran. I ran faster than I have ever run in my life. I knew something bad was about to happen.</p>\n<p>I got into my car and hit the gas. I drove straight to Louis’ house. I knew that sometimes his mom would let him sleep in while she went to church. I knocked on the door, he opened it after peeping through the window.</p>\n<p>“Hi Anya!” he squealed, clearly awake.</p>\n<p>“I’m gonna take you somewhere fun!” I said, scooping him up in my arms.</p>\n<p>We got to the store, the one that offered to print pictures. I wanted to print the picture immediately. I did not know what I would do with it, but I knew it would give me something those kids already had. But when I entered the store, Dash was already there.</p>\n<p>“Anya, give me the camera.”</p>\n<p>“No, the project’s due in two days, let me print the pictures.”</p>\n<p>Dash gave me a long look. “They told me you trespassed.”</p>\n<p>“Just let me print the pictures.”</p>\n<p>“I can’t let you do that Anya.”</p>\n<p>“I love you.”</p>\n<p>He grabbed my arm and took the camera from me. I thought about Louis in my car, the skittles I gave him probably smeared and melting over his cute little face. I kissed Dash right then. I moved my hand under his shirt, felt his chest. I thought about my mother, what she wanted, and then I knew I had to destroy it. We stayed there for a small eternity, making sketches of each other with our hands, tracing the edges of our backs.</p>\n<p>Finally, I looked up at him.</p>\n<p>“I like how your eyes look,” he said, no. He whispered it. “Bewitching.”</p>\n<p>That’s when I shoved him. I shoved him so hard I heard him cry out in pain. I grabbed the camera.</p>\n<p><i>And then that’s when you stepped outside and the hotness hit, and Louis was gone?</i></p>\n<p>Yes. I just got in the car anyways. I just drove. I refused to look at the backseat, where Louis was slumped over. I didn’t know where to go. I just kept driving. I couldn’t stop. I broke out of my trance when I saw Dash driving behind me. Then I started noticing two other cars I had seen in the school parking lot before.</p>\n<p><i>And then?</i></p>\n<p>And then…</p>\n<p><i>There was the crash, wasn’t there? And then… Louis</i></p>\n<p>gone.</p>\n<p><i>The car</i></p>\n<p>gone.</p>\n<p><i>The camera</i></p>\n<p>gone.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><i>So I went to the beginning, and I’ve reached the crash</i></p>\n<p>Is that it? Is that the end of the story?</p>\n<p><i>Maybe, maybe not. I guess that is why I am here. I have to decide, is this the end for me?</i></p>\n<p>What was the song I was playing?</p>\n<p><i>A song for your mother, for Dash. The things you can’t say. A song that isn’t finished.</i></p>\n<p>I thought you were here to find out why you exist.</p>\n<p><i>Anya — I’m the part of you that makes up a sad talking piano because you are all alone. The part of you that keeps on making melodies even though you haven’t seen sheet music in a month. The part of you that wonders why you had to pick up Louis. The part of you that understands why you did anyways. He was your backup plan. But you go on, you pick up your things and you run. From the perfect lawns and neat hedges, with a camera in your hand. With pictures of things you can’t explain but know too well. What will I do now?</i></p>\n<p>Anya stands. Her shirt is drenched. She knocks down the cart of trays, they make a sound that thunders against the walls and rattles the earth.</p>\n<p>“What the fuck?” Rory says peering up from his book. Dash looks straight at Anya, eyes wide.</p>\n<p>“Wait is that?” Heather turns too. Her pale eyes adjust to the dark corner. “It’s that cunt.”</p>\n<p>Anya walks over, she raises two fingers to her eyes, she turns them and draws a line from herself to them. An invisible line, as fantastical and solid as her phantom piano.</p>\n</div>","title_display":"Conversations with a Phantom Piano","group":"writing"},"surfacing":{"page":"<div class=story>\n\t\t<h2>Surfacing</h2>\n\t\t<span class=story-date>November 10, 2022</span>\n\t\t<hr><p>“I peed into a cup today.”</p>\n<p>The words fell out of Marnie’s mouth. Nobody was there to pick them off the ground, thoughts not yet fully formed meant to be digested and not regurgitated into the open air. She could taste them, the compulsivity and randomness of her inner monologues, their acidity. Suddenly she felt sick. How funny. She was just at the clinic earlier that day.</p>\n<p>She traversed a sidewalk soaked in wet leaves, the texture so meat-like she thought she was making her way down an unfurled umbilical cord, air as thick as placenta. She stepped onto an empty transit bus, her head full of the bus’s big tires on the road, black against black. She lurched either way as the bus rolled forward and felt two opposing forces yanking her apart. The first was the long shrieks of the bus’s breaks as it barely managed to stop at each intersection, and the second was the long blades of orange light that slid through the windows, a mixture made from the brown of wet leaves and red from the setting sun. The scratches of sound and color filled the crevices of her brain like cold water finding its way through fractal cracks in ice. She was going to shatter. Thank God her stop was near.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Marnie got to Webber’s grill ten minutes late. She had left her room a mess, clothes spilling out of drawers like limp bodies, her red scarf had been spread out on her bed like a river of blood. <i>All this carnage</i>, thought Marnie faced with the plain wooden doors of the restaurant, <i>just to listen to a man talk about himself for two hours</i>. At least he’ll get the bill.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>George was tall. That was Marnie’s first impression. He had on a checkered green sweater which went well with his grey, unremarkable face. The way he spoke was self-congratulatory, with no real intention of listening to the person he was talking to. He reminded Marnie of the foxes used in Aesop’s fables used to tell lessons about people who thought they were all that.</p>\n<p>“When can I see you again?” he asked by the end of their meal. Steaks had been devoured, wine consumed, the check gotten and paid for.</p>\n<p>Marnie laughed, reflexively covering her mouth. “I’ll have to check my calendar, thanks for dinner.”</p>\n<p>Marnie walked George to his car, where he offered her a ride, but she declined. He drove off while she looked on, his red convertible getting smaller and smaller on the dimming horizon until it was just a two-dimensional speck in the distance. She turned away from the road and walked towards the downtown, crossing a bridge. Grey clouds crossed over a deep purple sky and Marnie thought it looked like a giant blueberry strudel. She reached her hands out from her pockets, stretching her tendons in the cold. Her hands were painted the same color as the sky,  blisters and bruises from a week of dish duty.</p>\n<p>Her phone rang. She checked; it was her mother. She let it run its course, but when it finally stopped it was only replaced by a call from her sister. Marnie let out a small groan, relented, and picked up.</p>\n<p>“Marnie, she’s going crazy. Can you call her?” Emma fumed into the phone.</p>\n<p>“I can’t, I don’t know how to talk to her.” Marnie scratched the bottom edge of the bridge railing with the tip of her boot. She hoped that she sounded logical, maybe even hurtful.</p>\n<p>“You’re going to have to face her eventually, it’s not safe for you, leaving home like that. Do you have money? I can pay for the bus.” Emma offered.</p>\n<p>Marnie shrugged at no one in particular.  She kept toying with the bridge railing, its sharp rust digging into the faux leather of her shoes. Then two words fluttered out of her so fast she heard herself say them without saying them herself.</p>\n<p>“I’m pregnant.”</p>\n<p>For the first time, Emma paused. Phone static immediately swallowed up the hundred or so miles between the two sisters. A bird flew across the canal and Marnie followed its path with her eyes. She knew that the sun had sunken completely by then because the bird’s feathers had lost all their color. Marnie found it poetic — a silhouette making its way home in the dark.</p>\n<p>“Marnie, I don’t know what to say,” said Emma. Marnie silently laughed at this confession. “Are you taking care of yourself? Have you eaten today?”</p>\n<p>“Don’t worry about me, I had steak tonight,” Marnie smiled into the phone. Her head was still pounding from the wine.</p>\n<p>“Is it Nick’s?”</p>\n<p>“Well, it’s mine,” replied Marnie.</p>\n<p>Emma let out a tired sigh. She was in her softened state now, and Marnie liked this version of her sister, when she redirected her energy from sounding smart to defending against a common threat. Emma had won every fight she has gotten in; she always got her way.</p>\n<p>“Marnie, listen to me. Are you listening? I don’t think you are. But that doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter if it’s Nick’s or whoever’s, I’ll convince Mom, she’ll come around.”</p>\n<p>There was another pause. The static came in again with its distant prickling. No birds flew across the canal this time.</p>\n<p>“Please, come home.”</p>\n<p><i>Oh Emma,</i> thought Marnie. <i>I’m never going back, but I can’t bear to say it to your stupid, perfect face. </i>She hung up.</p>\n<p>Marnie sank into herself. To Emma it was all a vague memory. To Marnie it was a nightmare she woke up from and could never forget. The slaps dealt, the words fired from a shotgun tongue, the lines drawn with pointed fingers as her own mother compared her two daughters, one her angel, the other one the devil herself.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>She was just a girl walking in the opposite direction that the earth was spinning, wading through ghosts, her knees determined to get her back to that home-like place. Marnie had resisted the urge to think about him for the entire day, but now the memories escaped like fireflies, coming in and out of illumination as her old teenage synapses fired, replaying the best summer that ruined her life. She let them fling towards her, and she caught the buzzing visions one by one, crushing each between her fingers.</p>\n<p>The first time she saw Nick was behind the bleachers. The light came in slanted and lit up half of his face. His brown eyes were at odds with each other, one demure chocolate, the other brazen gold. He liked philosophy and poetry, things that Marnie stood on the periphery of but never dared to dive into. He took her pages of half-hazard stories and read them with serious brows and pursed lips. He would look up, smile, and reveal his tongue purpled by his favorite grape candy.</p>\n<p>She hated that the words from his mouth were the kind of thing that could save her. Words so ripe like they were derived from nature itself, their odd combination of granularity and chance, something she could not reproduce no matter how hard she tried. She loved the look of him, that swirl of his brown hair, the odd tapping he did with his pinky at the edge of a counter or desk, his deep green hoodie, that walk full of schoolboy coolness.</p>\n<p>So she couldn’t even blame herself. That pivotal night when she snuck out of the house, evading her mother and sister’s careful gaze, sprinting to his car obscured by some bushes. They went to a nearby park and strolled under grinning, silver stars, gagging at the smell of lake water and then giggling at their exaggerated disgust.</p>\n<p>A stroll led to a kiss, and that led to them in the back of his car, his denim jacket hanging out the window, Marnie’s pajamas on the dashboard. Marnie shook her head, shaking away the summer warmth that crept into her cheeks, replacing it with the stinging cold. In the end, cold was all she got from Nick. Here she was, walking up to a boarding house three months later, still thinking about him, left with his uneven eyes, her own dissatisfaction.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The door shut behind her. It was like Marnie’s past in its entirety was locked away, left in the blasts of cold October air. She was now confronted by her room’s stifling warmth, she refused it — this moment. A wave of nausea took over and Marnie bolted for the toilet bowl.</p>\n<p>When all the organic matter that was not each of her clamoring cells were in the toilet, an emptiness settled into all corners of her body. Her clammy skin stuck to the white tiling of the bathroom, and the yellowing grout imprinted its gridwork onto her palms and the outside of her legs. Blue from the porthole window above washed over her skin, and when she leaned to examine her own throw up, it looked green and alive.</p>\n<p>Like words that bubbled out of her without her permission, this feeling that she was all she had came pouring out, melting her vision, and causing her to shake. She slid from her knelt position over the basin and rested her arm on the ridge of the bathtub, the energy gone from her body. Her back curved forward like a willow tree, a sour ache wrapped around her throat, and she felt her head droop from her neck. She brought a hand up to her face and buried her eyes.</p>\n<p>There was always something she was gripping, clawing at, fighting with clenched fists. Maybe that thing was the silence in response to her question “What am I without them?” whispered into a gulf as wide as the Pacific Ocean. Maybe that thing was the fact her sister loved her so much yet so incorrectly. Maybe it was because she could not remember her mother saying something nice to her in the past two years. Maybe that thing was how she had finally been held so tight that she melted out of existence completely, but now her existence felt so piercing, and that existence was merging in on the existence of another thing inside her. She didn’t know then, but she was just on the brink of what her life was going to be. Not yet though. All she knew now was that letting go was not an option. It hurt, this tightly wound posture she maintained, hands of her past pulling at her shoulders, her head cycling between looking back and facing life’s momentum. She had yet to stand up, but in due time she would — grab the wrists of the past and yank them forward with her.</p>\n<p>And from the bathroom floor, her grip unyielding, she cried, droplets and droplets of <i>I want I want I want</i>.</p>\n</div>","title_display":"Surfacing","group":"writing"},"poison":{"page":"<div class=story>\n\t\t<h2>Poison</h2>\n\t\t<span class=story-date>October 13, 2022</span>\n\t\t<hr><p>The rain in Taiwan liked drama. It was only after an afternoon of air-rippling hotness that water would come down in boatloads, landing on the paved streets with reverberating cracks. There really was nothing to do as a seven-year-old in a foreign country on those afternoons except to lay around and eat mangoes until my belly swelled with happiness. Dinner would roll around on the kind of soft grey clouds that tumbled out of thunderstorms, and I would be compelled to set the table, scoop the rice, hoist chairs from the other rooms. The smell of food would stifle any of my lingering jet lag and the door would swivel open and close for my myriad of cousins. They floated in and out like anxious sailboats — momentarily returning to a safe harbor before bounding back to choppy seas. We would crowd around the table that was strewn across a giant ledge in the room, insulated from the percussive Taipei streets, my aunt’s gossip evoking scandalous gasps from everyone, even the most stoic uncle, and my grandfather’s one-thousandth retelling of his teenage hijinks causing us to double over in hopeless giggles.</p>\n<p>Like the droplets left over from the rain, ever-forming into mounds and pulled down by gravity, these moments, they grabbed me by the wrist and planted deep into what I know as those rose-tinged years — “nostalgia”. When I sit in the parking lot, waiting forever to be picked up from school and I catch the word “childhood” escape from someone’s mouth, I would think back to the endless platters of fruit oozing with sweetness and the laughter only experienced with those who shared the same blood. But there was also something else. It lurked between the window panes and beneath the trees stirring in the dark; it was like a long, mourning cry, like dead waters stinking in a ditch. Something in the rain eclipsed all my moral soundness, and it had led me to do bad things.</p>\n<p>Da Yin was everybody’s favorite cousin. She had eyes that were prone to scrunch when smiling, and a big, laughing mouth. Da Yin got good grades. Not the best, but good enough for a girl, said all the relatives. She always helped when you asked her to. Her thick black hair was always readily swooshed into a low ponytail — pretty, but out of the way. Every morning I remember making the twenty-minute trek to the apartment she resided in, brick pavement straddling a road lined with coconut trees, the air still sticky from the smell of late-night skewers. After a sharp turn into an alleyway not far from the Temple, I would find myself at her apartment, where anything imaginable, from old mail to dirty food containers occupied its floor, where everything was coated in a layer of clammy, tropical dust. Her dad, my uncle, was a lean, sallow man who had a back stiffly curved from years of dreaming up different business ventures that all ran into the ground with a resounding thud. He sat near the front entrance playing video games next to a dirty fish tank and occasionally exported a long line of expletives into the rest of the apartment.</p>\n<p>I would follow Da Yin around like a duckling, imitating her mannerisms, trying to do anything I could to make her eyes scrunch and force laughter out of her big mouth. Sometimes I would even resort to saying something stupid so that she would let out an exasperated sigh, call me a silly foreigner, give me a poke on the shoulder, squeeze my cheeks, throw me up into the air with her strong arms and twirl me around like the princess young girls believed themselves to be. But there was a hidden sharpness to Da Yin, moments when her mask slipped, and something lethal came out like smoke. Now looking back, her mask was made of glass.</p>\n<p>“Can I try some?” I asked one afternoon when we were laying on the mattress in the middle of the living room. We had exhausted our afternoon itinerary of doodling, jumping rope, bad karaoke, and experimenting with expired make up. So there I was, observing the wobbly ceiling fan when Da Yin took out a package of Hawthorn berry candy, a sugary cylinder of dried fruit cut into thin slices.</p>\n<p>She nodded. “Of course, they don’t have stuff like this in <i>America</i>.”</p>\n<p>There definitely was hawthorn candy in the States. Da Yin always had wild notions of America. For me, it was just an endless stream of homework and dance lessons. Taipei was freedom, away from my mom’s reign over my every second. She was off meeting with college friends, recounting their “rebellious years”, years which she would try desperately to keep me from entering, but I have inevitably stepped into now.</p>\n<p>Da Yin peeled off the candy wrapper.  I could feel my eyes widen at Da Yin’s methodical hands, tearing the paper so that it came off into a perfect, fuzzy-edged spiral. The sweet roll of hawthorn and sugar tumbled out at once, falling on the mattress with a bounce.</p>\n<p>Without thinking, I reached for it, scooped it up, and swallowed the entire candy.</p>\n<p>Da Yin stood up from the mattress. Her bare feet landed in the narrow strip of floor that was free from trash. “That was my last piece!”</p>\n<p>I looked at her, not yet grasping the serious situation I had stumbled into. I blurted out haphazardly, “I’m sorry Da Yin, I wasn’t thinking.”</p>\n<p>Da Yin yanked me by my shirt. My toes still grazed the mattress, but I was suspended in the air, hoisted up like a ragdoll.</p>\n<p>She unclenched my shirt and began moving about the room like an odd Godzilla variant as I stayed in a shocked stillness. Empty bottles were being knocked down by her slow pacing and newspapers crunched under her narrow feet. I could tell she was fuming, but I was unsure how to approach this version of Da Yin I had never seen before.</p>\n<p>I resorted to bargaining.  “I can tell my mom to buy you more! Are there different flavors? What kind do you like the most?”</p>\n<p>Da Yin turned to me. She did so slowly, which now in retrospect, seemed cruel to do to a child, to turn to them slowly as they watched on in terror.</p>\n<p>“I bought that candy with my own money!” Da Yin said, each word a punch, and she looked at me, her brows furrowed as if her forehead was made of warm wax. She reached out one hand and grabbed my face. At that moment, I realized that Da Yin possessed the sharpest nails in the entire world, almond-shaped and filed to perfection.</p>\n<p>“Spit it out!”</p>\n<p>I tried, I really did. Alas, the hawthorn candy was well on its way to being digested. But Da Yin only squeezed my face harder. I didn’t yell for help. We stayed there. I could hear the clacking of my uncle’s computer games from out in the hall. Time slowed. What I remember now is an eternity of her big, unmoving mouth, her nails that dug into my still round cheeks, her stare locking onto mine, a mixture of mischief and something insidious permeating her irises. She let go at some point and I instantly crumpled into a ball. I coughed out a weak apology, but she simply strolled out of the room.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The next few afternoons I spent rocking on my grandfather’s vine-woven chair, thinking about her. Like that chair, which was secretly rotting from Taiwan’s tenacious humidity, the image of Da Yin turning towards me started to decompose, and its decaying debris punctuated my every thought. I became obsessed with her sharp nails and laughing eyes, scared by her rage and power. I was too young to admit to myself that, after such a blatant transgression, I wanted to go visit her again. So I tried to avoid her altogether at family dinners. I vowed to never catch any attention, to scoop rice with expert precision, set down chopsticks like putting babies to sleep, hoist chairs completely off the ground as to prevent any screeching across the floor. But when I saw her five days later, I was surprised to find that Da Yin’s rage had vanished like a summer thunderstorm.</p>\n<p>My mom had dragged me to Da Yin’s apartment to be babysat because she could no longer stand me. I was like a little wraith according to her, ghoulishly haunting each of her day trips and high school reunions, twitching nervously, scratching my mosquito bites, incessantly asking her when the dessert was coming.</p>\n<p>I entered Da Yin’s living room as if the trash scattered about were grenades, but I was met with a familiar smile and jingle of laughter. My mother exchanged pleasantries with Da Yin before leaving, her steps down the stairs lighter now that she was free of me. Da Yin waited a few minutes before throwing me the biggest smile.</p>\n<p>“Do you want to go play outside?” she asked.</p>\n<p>I was relieved, happy. “Yes!”</p>\n<p>“Ok! I’m sorry but I have to do the laundry and finish my homework, don’t leave the alley, and don’t tell your mom I let you play alone,” said Da Yin wiggling her eyebrows up and down.</p>\n<p>I nodded in earnest and then ran down the stairs, holding in a grin. I was almost unable to contain my excitement of having the old Da Yin back, pushing all my confusion and fear to the deepest part of my stomach.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Wang Wang was a boy who lived in an apartment that shared the same alleyway as Da Yin. He had chubby cheeks and spiky black hair that sprung from his perfectly round head. Every time I saw him, he was sweating — fat droplets rolling down the sides of his forehead, his bouncy tan skin twinkling in the sun. We became friends the way childhood friends are made: him showing me his collection of toy airplanes and me showing him the assorted pins on my turquoise backpack. Wang Wang and I would spend afternoons with chalk in one hand and peeled lychee in the other, rainbow dust and fruit juices creeping down our wrists.</p>\n<p>On that day, we saw who could sprint down the alleyway fastest, and afterwards Wang Wang invited me into his apartment as we were leaning against the apartments’ browned bricks, our muscles atrophied from that childlike bullishness that pushed the body beyond its pain signals. I had wondered aloud about what his home looked like before, so I guess this was just the natural progression of our friendship.  Wang Wang revealed to me on our walk up that he lived with his mom who was the hired help for a single dad and his daughter.  We came up the final flight of stairs and were faced with a tall white door with a pin pad. Wang Wang entered a code and the door unlocked with a clack.</p>\n<p>“It’s so bright! Like out of a magazine,” I marveled as we gingerly carried our shoes from the foyer to Wang Wang and his mother’s allotted room. The apartment was in pristine shape. Every surface was microscopically clean and the air was thick with the smell of citrus flavored disinfectant.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, don’t touch anything,” Wang Wang warned. A grey severity had passed over his brows and he moved through the hall like a ghost passing over into the next life. I pursed my lips and followed suit.</p>\n<p>The apartment was a long L shape, equipped with big windows and tiled floors. Maybe it was because I was just in Da Yin’s apartment, but I was mystified by the dichotomy between the two homes separated by only two walls and an alleyway. We padded along, and the floor lowered from a tiled ledge to wood paneling that seemed older than the rest of the apartment. This was where Wang Wang stayed with his mother.</p>\n<p>“The girl who lives here, her name is Pei Er,” Wang Wang said, closing the door at the end of the hall. “She’s sick.”</p>\n<p>“What do you mean?” I inquired while looking around. Wang Wang lived in a shoebox with a window so narrow that the phrase “a sliver of glass” would be better fit to describe it. A knife’s edge of afternoon gold landed onto the one mattress where he sat, and it made his hair look like it was on fire. The rest of the room was occupied by two plastic boxes of clothes and a shelf stacked with schoolbooks and canned food.</p>\n<p>Wang Wang leaned in. I braced myself for what he was about to divulge. “The world is poisonous to her.”</p>\n<p>I found myself confused.</p>\n<p>“She can’t eat most things, not even bananas,” Wang Wang explained. “She can’t even leave the house unless my Ma or her Ba goes with her. He took her to Disney world last year, and this place called Singapore,” Wang Wang said as if reciting an oral tradition. He lifted his hands as if holding a small box. “But when they travel, they have to bring a whole case of pills.”</p>\n<p>I nodded. “So that’s why her house looks like a hospital.”</p>\n<p>Wang Wang agreed. “Sometimes we play hide and seek, she’s really good with words so I let her name my airplanes.” Wang Wang had never let me name his airplanes before.</p>\n<p>“One day I’m going to be a doctor and help her get better,” Wang Wang said, bringing a closed fist to his chest. He said this with an earnestness only found in children. I felt something between curiosity and envy sneak up my throat.</p>\n<p>“Where is she? Is she home?” I asked. I had not noticed a trace of dust or living things when we had entered.</p>\n<p>“She’s in her room. Always sleeping. And my Ma has to nap with her.”</p>\n<p>“Well, if the whole world was poisonous to me, I would sleep all day too,” I said, trying to stretch my prepubescent empathy but only succeeding at seeming like I did.</p>\n<p>He rolled his eyes and showed me a laminated list his mother had of all of Pei Er’s allergies. All nuts, milk, wheat, eggs, most fruit, shellfish, the list went on so long I wondered if Pei Er could eat anything at all. I looked out the “window” and noticed that it had started pouring outside. We pulled the one meager curtain closed and made shadow puppets in the lamplight, telling ourselves stories while cloaked in artificial light, our imaginations so bizarre and silly we forgot about our mosquito-bitten legs.</p>\n<p>Before leaving, I tried to catch a glimpse of Pei Er through the crack of a door. But all I could see were Wang Wang’s mother’s tired, sleeping arms. I reckoned Pei Er probably looked sunken and malnourished, like one of those starving kids on National Geographic magazines.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>I got back to Da Yin’s apartment before dinner. She decided that we were going to walk back to my grandparents’ house for a free meal since she was too tired to cook. At a crosswalk, I told Da Yin about Pei Er’s controversial existence as a final peace offering. I knew that she would love it; Da Yin handled gossip like dough: kneading and molding it, waiting for it to rise with suspense between her fingers before licking its golden crust with her own embellishments.</p>\n<p>“That’s so unfortunate,” she said, jutting out her right hip and resting her manicured hand on it.  “So she can’t even eat a hardboiled egg?”</p>\n<p>“Yeah,” I said, all chipper. Pei Er was just a character in my head, a sickly, mythical beast. All that had mattered was the glint in Da Yin’s now-interested eyes.</p>\n<p>“You know, I think you should try to be friends with her,” Da Yin suggested nonchalantly. “She’s probably lonely.”</p>\n<p>I nodded. I was busy looking at the people passing holding umbrellas of every color, each still adorned with water droplets that sputtered the red from the traffic lights over the slick black streets. “Yeah maybe, but she has Wang Wang, he likes her a lot.”</p>\n<p>Da Yin chuckled. She put her hand in my hair, brushing with her fingers and gripping their tangled ends before finally running them through completely.</p>\n<p>“But they do have a really pretty apartment. I bet she has nice toys.” I offered, and then, I began to drone on about how nice Pei Er’s home was, how I couldn’t spot even a pinch of dust. I glanced over, and I swore I saw knuckles tighten, the white of her bones against her already pale skin. Da Yin clapped her hands together and the smack brought me back to reality. “Hmmm, yes, I think we should bake her a cake! She must not get <i>any</i> good food!”</p>\n<p>“But she can only eat…” I paused; the list of allergens scrolled through my brain in a blur. “Water?!” I exclaimed. “Can we make a cake with just water?”</p>\n<p>Da Yin stared straight ahead as she grabbed my hand to cross the street. “We’ll figure something out, that poor, poor girl.”</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The next day I found Da Yin had materialized baking supplies from rubble, bowls and bags of unnamed ingredients stood erect, proud against the slow decay her apartment cursed all its inhabitants with.</p>\n<p>Da Yin was muttering something from the pantry.</p>\n<p>“Mom made me fried taro pancakes with extra sauce for breakfast,” I offered this information as if it was interesting. “Did <i>you</i> make something Da Yin?”</p>\n<p>Da Yin walked out with a cake-like thing sleeping soundlessly in a pan between her hands and multiple damp rags. “Yes, it’s for your friend.”</p>\n<p>“Are you sure Da Yin?” I asked. I could hear my own voice carrying a note of higher-pitched distrust.</p>\n<p>“Why not? I made it with special ingredients,” Da Yin replied. She winked. I didn’t know how pretty someone could be until I saw her sharp lashes flick so effortlessly at me that morning.</p>\n<p>I nodded. But knowing what I know now, I can’t help but conjecture that I had already grasped what was about to transpire, but I had chosen childhood innocence, however artificial, over all else.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>I found Wang Wang outside in the alleyway with his airplane collection nicely lined up on some crates. “Aren’t you scared someone is going to steal your planes?” I inquired.</p>\n<p>He looked downcast. Wang Wang had the blackest eyes, the kind where you couldn’t tell where the iris ended, and the pupil started. Now they had a watery shine that made me want to crouch down and catch their residue with my hands.</p>\n<p>“I’m selling them, my Ma said I had to” he said. \"I can give you a discount.</p>\n<p>I examined his collection for the thousandth time. I tried to cheer him up. “Let’s make a poster! Or I can draw something with chalk?”</p>\n<p>Wang Wang’s eyes suddenly got very itchy, and he started to rub them, so I wrapped my bony arms around him,  our sweaty shirts sticking to each other, my mosquito bite scabs brushing against his.</p>\n<p>“Da Yin made cake,” I murmured into his ear. “She says it’s for Pei Er, but we can have some too.”</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Wang Wang’s mother was out on her weekly grocery run. Even then I knew that this was a good thing, that it would make things go easier. We knocked on Pei Er’s door.</p>\n<p>“Let’s just give her a small piece,” whispered Wang Wang, who was making eye contact with the cake.  He could hardly stop salivating.</p>\n<p>The door opened normally. For some reason I had imagined a dramatic swing accompanied by a slow and dreadful creak.</p>\n<p>“Who are you?” asked the girl who was Pei Er, looking straight at me.</p>\n<p>“I’m Wang Wang’s best friend,” I said, puffing up my chest. “We made you a special cake.”</p>\n<p>I lifted the pan for her to examine as I examined her in return. She looked completely normal and healthy. She brought her nose gingerly to the cake, sniffing the yellow loaf.</p>\n<p>“Why is it special?” she asked. “Did my Ba say I can eat it?”</p>\n<p>Wang Wang crossed his arms. “It’s special because you <i>can</i> eat it. Her cousin made sure of it. Da Yin’s a nurse.”</p>\n<p>She wasn’t. I don’t know how Wang Wang came to this conclusion, but I think it was because he saw Da Yin measure my temperature once in her strange, methodical way.</p>\n<p>Pei Er smiled. “It smells delicious!”</p>\n<p>We crowded around the breakfast table, our feet dangling off the highchairs, looking like a huddle of little adults. Pei Er scooped some cake straight out of the pan with a spoon. It looked perfectly moist, glistening with melted sugar. She stuffed the cake into her mouth.</p>\n<p>“This…” Pei Er paused. She closed her eyes. “Is the best thing I have ever had.”</p>\n<p>Wang Wang gulped, hunger in his eyes. “Can I try some?”</p>\n<p>Pei Er offered him her spoon and he tried some too, his eyes widening as he chewed. All he could do was nod. I giggled. I grabbed some cake with my hand. Pei Er followed suit. Before we knew it, the three of us were covered in cake, smeared with its sugary goodness.</p>\n<p>I still don’t know what happened first. Either Pei Er fell off her chair gripping at her neck, or Wang Wang’s mom came sprinting straight to the kitchen, squeaky clean vegetables wrapped in plastic and Styrofoam flying out of her hands.  All I remember is Pei Er’s face turning blue, the word “water” escaping her pink mouth. I remember turning to her and smiling. I could feel my own bizarre ecstasy, my blood boiling. An apparition of Da Yin’s big mouth spreading into a grin appeared and I felt my smile growing wider parallel to hers. I made sure to remain unblinking. Pei Er’s thin voice grew thinner until she looked like a fish out of water, her mouth gaping in open air, her small contractions slowing into stillness. I remember Wang Wang leaping out of his chair and panickily shaking her shoulders, trying to rid her of the poison we dealt with smiling faces.</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry, please Pei Er,” Wang Wang said through the streams of mucus running down his face like a freshly thawed mountain stream. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.”</p>\n<p>Unlike when I was in Da Yin’s apartment with the candy down my throat, <i>I</i> was the one with the luxury to gawk. Some time passed, and I felt my voyeurism sliced into two when Wang Wang’s mother shot me a murderous glare. I ran as fast as I could out of the apartment, down the concrete steps and into the thundering city, where rain shot down like bullets, bright blue lightning crawling above through the shifting greys and blacks of the sky. I ran all the way back to my grandparents’ house, where I was interrogated. I returned each probe with a steady answer, the monkey in my brain finding itself more civilized than it had ever been.</p>\n<p>What happened with Pei Er or Wang Wang is still a mystery to me, but I still turn over these events in my head like loose soil above a casket, unable to finally bury what could not rest.  I only see Da Yin now when I scroll through Facebook. She cut her hair at some point, blunt ends now hit her chin — it looked good, the style suited her. Apparently she had given birth to a healthy daughter. She is laughing in all her pictures. But still, the Da Yin steeped in summer rain, the Da Yin that brewed my childhood, is imprinted in my mind. I see the slow turning of her head towards me, but I never really see her face because in its place would always be my own.</p>\n</div>","title_display":"Poison","group":"writing"},"greys-gift":{"page":"<div class=story>\n\t\t<h2>Grey’s Gift</h2>\n\t\t<span class=story-date>Spring 2022</span>\n\t\t<hr><p>All that could be felt by Grey spun itself into thread, which she would parse through using her fingers and try to make sense of, but, like a mortal attempting to cipher the threads of fates, never was she successful. Ring! The telephone invaded her thoughts, but as Grey reached for the receiver, she remembered that she had yet to go to the post office, where it should be! A package — heavy and wrapped with thick yellow paper and a little tightening of twine — she could hear its solid, crumpling sound as she opened it. And the bright feeling she was bound to board and soar on when the sight of the gift entered her eyes! But alas, the voice of the phone spoke:</p>\n<p>“Courtney, how are you, I have been thinking of you, but something has prevented me from calling you…” her mother rambled as Grey began rolling a thin strip of paper that was lying limp on her desk into a tight spiral. Her mother’s voice, a soft, weak siren, came in and out of its deep waters, and Courtney began her journey to the post office. She could picture the blue of the sky, and from her mind’s eye, Grey could see two people wearing bright yellow jackets. How serendipitous?! That two unrelated people would head out their doors from different corners of the city with the same piercing shade painted on their backs. The event pleased her, and it made Grey wonder about the odds of her life, and the odds of the giver of her gift. A strong inflection in the still waters of her mother’s incantations drew her back, pulling Grey’s opinionated chin from the window to the curvature of the receiver.</p>\n<p>“Oh Court! You really should’ve married him when you had the chance. Anne is going to have another baby, and Louis is the best of fathers,” she said.</p>\n<p>Grey always thought her mother talked in a rather wasteful way — Edwina Moore threw words carelessly and strung them together with proper syntax and impeccable drama, but failed to find a majestical spine that would connect a beast’s appendages, into something meaningful… worthwhile. And so it lay limp around her, pieces to revel at, dismembered and bloody. A day thirty years ago shot through Grey’s mind. Grey — Courtney rather, yes she was Courtney then — would stand at the edge of the tulip bed, as her mother would fret and spin around her, like a wild panther, while her words confusingly clawed at her. Either her dress was not spotless, or she spoke too loudly at supper, or her French was not up to the tastes of the other Edwinas of society. Grey let these memories pass, but the indignance they once held left a tremor in her small heart.</p>\n<p>“I do believe I have quite a few errands to run,” Grey started. Like a hawk she tried to find a point where she could exit, to dive away, to get back to the steady ground of her life. <i>Wasn’t the notion insane? One’s own life. How could you own something that you had no business purchasing at the market.</i>  </p>\n<p>“But I’ve barely just spoken to you, and I have not told you what they were saying about you today when I went to the department store yesterday,” Mrs. Moore protested.</p>\n<p>Grey sighed, the paper that she had been rolling had wasted away into a thin string of fibre, and she could feel the pattern of its motion on her fingertips. Her sigh must have been extraordinarily audible, because Edwina Moore began again in a sharper tone. Grey could see her brown curls, once tinted with red, now with grey, but still glistening with the resilience of the wife of a parliamentarian. They shone towards her with a blinding light, and Grey squeezed her eyelids together as her mother’s phantom wrapped around her head.</p>\n<p>“Courtney, I do not care about your errands, I am actually calling you because of your concerning disposition, and as your mother I deserve at least that,” said Edwina Moore. “Please tell me you have at least made yourself useful this past summer, Mrs. Lowe told me you had stopped going to the charity dinners on Sunday.”</p>\n<p>Grey assured her mother that all was well, that her head had been bothering her, that everything but the monkey in her that makes decisions had been plotting against her. Her mother accepted her excuses one by one like a boy holding out a basket to an apple-picker. The call was finished — at last — Grey leapt out into the summer air like a salmon bounding upstream.</p>\n<p>Eyes, in all shades of possible plumage: green, sapphire, the deepest shade of brown, hid under neatly arranged sun caps and umbrellas. Grey was one for peering, and she did. Oh dear! Did anyone look at her? She wanted it, others’ eyes, and yet she did not know what she would do with them, other than take them to the ocean to watch the waves lap back and forth, and throw them into the soft dunes. What was she? A grain of sand? She did feel rather granular as the sun began its descent, pixelating details, shrinking her down, making her a point, a bee in a field, a boat in a bay. It was a bearable feeling, this shrinking, but it was also unequally unbearable  — she was devastated. She wanted expansion, to grow big and devour and take from the world. Her chest tightened and constricted. <i>Not now!</i> <i>Look around you!</i> Look at the children, the dogs, the splendour of flowers spilling in abundance.</p>\n<p>These risings and lowerings came over her whenever she headed to the post office. A bashful encounter, a triumphant day of errands, an angering conversation beneath polite words, they flitted through her like endless jolts of waves washing up and over, drawing in, drawing back, towards Rome and then out to the horizon.</p>\n<p>But what was the use of these wonderings when she was about to receive her gift? It was from Joanne. Joanne, the star in her night sky, the Joanne whose lips were always painted red. “I love you,” she had said with those lips one night. Like a spell, those words have governed Grey’s life from the moment they spilt into the world. But Joanne was not here, she was in the painful “there”, a place Grey could only understand but could only touch when she unravelled the brown parcels she was sacredly allotted. <i>Was that enough</i>, Grey often wondered. Yes! She shouted it from rooftops. No! She thought to herself one late night pouring herself a cup of warm milk in the kitchen. To be held, that was too much one could ask for! And yet it was also all she had ever wanted.</p>\n<p>Grey’s shoes hit the pavement like beats from a metronome. She could feel it — Paris, Joanne’s home — getting closer. The summers she would spend there “studying art”, swinging from one cafe to another wrapped in her mother’s silks. Grey swore she could hear those dense afternoons under the sun, as the heat of it all exploded into storms around 4 o’clock, just to be brought up again into a frenzy by night bugs and their orchestral melodies.</p>\n<p>There stood the post office, on stout legs of brick, sporting a pair of dashing white windows looking out onto the busy street. Grey liked its posture, how neat it was, how the shrubbery was arranged around it, how no unnecessary accessories poked out sorely. Grey lifted her skirt. She carried herself up the steps like that of an altar, as if she was a sacrificial lamb — about to offer herself to Joanne, to decades of waiting before a lonely grave. She turned the door knob. It was shut. She tries again. Never did words hurt her so more than the sign that pressed itself up against the window: CLOSED.  <i>How dare they keep her from her?</i> A drop of rain theatrically lands on her cap, as if the period to the death sentence Grey felt hanging above the nape of her neck. <i>What if she had married, what if the love she had chosen was not worthy of the fortune of time she spent on it.</i> She grasped onto a nearby railing, the red rust crunching into her fine gloves, and her fine gloves becoming inkish under the accelerating rain — it was all becoming a single blur. This is real, <i>she was not dreaming</i>, only that it felt immoral that her gift was somewhere in “there”, on some hardy table, and here she was, on the steps, a fake devotee, a phoney, nothing at all.</p>\n<p>She stood at the door above the street, back erect and chin still sharp, but she seemed so small. One could see from the house across the street, a lady, two and forty, hidden beneath the armour of a black gown, arms mechanically crossed like a nutcracker. And what was in her eyes? The defensiveness of an animal backed into a corner, the hardness of someone who has lived in a room of her own, the wicked brilliance of a narrow creek that managed to carve a path for herself. Grey peered in one last time, into the dark of the closed post office. She could make out a golden outline now that the sun was halfway down the horizon, taking its last breath, exhaling soft rays into the office, diffused, spreading about. The brain did not matter at all! Grey can feel it, she was the thread being woven, and time, forever headed in one direction while immovable in the other, was finally within her grasp. She was no longer parsing, with glimpses of truth bestowing upon her. But she too was that divine hand. She could see it now. In the back, on a shelf — it sat like an Emperor: a glorious, brown package. <i>That</i> was Joanne’s, <i>that</i> was hers. <i>Theirs</i>. She was sure of it. And she will be back tomorrow.</p>\n</div>","title_display":"Grey’s Gift","group":"writing"}}
